Hassan, Royal Scientific Society of Jordan president Princess Sumaya El Hassan, Nobel laureate from Taiwan Yuan T.

Furthermore, Malaysia must remain committed to international collaboration and be proactive in science diplomacy.\u201d\n\nZakri, currently the fifth holder of the Tun Hussein Onn Chair in International Studies at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia, is a former science adviser to the Prime Minister and member of the Scientific Advisory Board to the-then United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.\n\nIn welcoming this latest accolade, MIGHT president and chief executive officer Datuk Dr Mohd Yusoff Sulaiman complimented Zakri\u2019s lifelong dedication in promoting international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cOur readiness in assimilating scientific advances and high technology remains the cornerstone of our wellbeing as one of the top trading nations in the world. For that, we need science leaders to champion it.\u201d",

It was followed by GPS with 22 seats, Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) six seats, Warisan three seats, and others four seats.\n\nThe Election Commission (EC) chairman Tan Sri Abdul Ghani Salleh announced that no political party has been able to obtain a simple majority after they failed to win 50 per cent out of 219 parliamentary seats in the GE15.\n\nWhen this announcement was made, the result for Kota Marudu parliamentary seat was not out yet.\n\nMeanwhile, PN chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is willing to collaborate with any party, except PH, that can accept its cause and principles in forming a clean and stable government.\n\nHe also said that PN had received a letter from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah and was instructed to finalise certain matters by tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\"There\u2019s no need for me to reveal the content of the letter.

The congratulatory phone calls from the Indonesian and Turkish presidents were outdone only by the personal drive from Subang to Putrajaya by the Sultan of Brunei, and if social media comments are to be believed, these influential Muslim leaders\u2019 overtures have helped moved domestic public opinion.\n\nBut the appointment of Cabinet ministers remains crucial.\n\nAs I write, WhatsApp groups continue to distribute different fake (or wish) lists daily, fuelling speculation and concern.\n\nAs much as appointments need to be made to balance political party strengths (and inevitably, feelings of personal gratitude), it would speak volumes if clean competence were to be the main driving force.\n\nThe timing of the 260th Conference of Rulers (scheduled as normal regardless of the election or its outcome) was coincidentally after the appointment of the Prime Minister but before that of his Cabinet.\n\nUpon its conclusion, the conference\u2019s chairman, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan, reiterated the Rulers\u2019 wish for politicians to stop using racial and religious issues to incite Malaysians against one another, to take particular heed of the Rukun Negara that was proclaimed by the fourth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, and for the new government to inculcate a spirit of togetherness.\n\nThis was in addition to a specific proposal to improve the judiciary by reforming the composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) so that none of its members are appointed by the Prime Minister.\n\n(Presently, five out of its nine members are appointed by the Prime Minister, while four are the nation\u2019s top judges.) This is particularly relevant given the number of politicians undergoing court cases at present.\n\nI hope that the government \u2013 and specifically, the new minister in charge \u2013 implements this change, joining his other ministerial colleagues to prioritise reforms that will cleanse our body politic of corruption alongside racial and religious hatred.\n\nTunku Zain Al-\u2018Abidin is founding president of Ideas.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",

        "HOST nation Qatar were pushed to the brink of an early elimination from their own World Cup after a 3-1 defeat to Senegal.\n\nGoals either side of half-time from Boulaye Dia and Famara Diedhiou gave Senegal the lead before Qatar substitute Mohammed Muntari replied in the 78th minute to set up a dramatic finale.\n\nSenegal substitute Bamba Dieng scored six minutes later to put the result beyond doubt and lift the African champions, who opened with a 2-0 loss to Holland, rightback into contention in Group A.\n\nThe defeat left bottom side Qatar sweating on results elsewhere if they are to avoid following South Africa in 2010 as only the second World Cup hosts to bow out after the first round.\n\nQatar had made a nervy start to the tournament in a 2-0 defeat to Ecuador and they again looked tentative against Senegal.\n\nThe Asian champions dropped their goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb to the bench after his shaky performance in the opener.\n\nHis replacement Meshaal Barsham did not inspire much confidence in the early stages, flapping at a corner as Senegal pushed for the opening goal.\n\nIsmaila Sarr and Nampalys Mendy had already missed scoring chances for Senegal by then, and Idrissa Gana Gueye and Youssouf Sabaly squandered more as the first half wore on.\n\nQatar spent most of the opening 45 minutes on the back foot but a rare break forward saw Akram Afif incensed not to be awarded a penalty after he was bundled over by Sarr.\n\nSenegal looked like they would head into half-time without managing to break down Qatar\u2019s resistance, only for the hosts to gift them a goal in the 41st minute.\n\nQatari defender Boualem Koukhi fluffed a clearance to leave Dia to pounce on the loose ball and fire it past Barsham.\n\nSenegal doubled their lead almost immediately after the break when Diedhiou glanced home a header at the near post from a corner.\n\nQatar began to show much more attacking ambition from two goals down and Afif was involved in everything.\n\nAlmoez Ali forced a fingertip save out of Senegal goalkeeper Eduoard Mendy before the Chelsea man again rescued the Africans from Ismaeel Mohamad\u2019s effort.\n\nMendy was rooted to his line when Muntari pulled one back for Qatar, powerfully heading home Mohamad\u2019s cross to haul the hosts back into it.\n\nThe goal lifted the crowd and sent Qatar surging forward in search of another, but Dieng nipped the revival in the bud in the 84th minute when he swept the ball home for Senegal\u2019s third.

        "AL KHOR, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Enner Valencia scored two first-half goals as Ecuador beat hosts Qatar 2-0 in the opening match of the FIFA World Cup on Sunday.\n\nThe Fenerbahce forward converted a penalty before powering home a header to give Gustavo Alfaro's side a perfect start in Group A.\n\nDespite having 47 percent of possession, the hosts didn't manage a single shot on target while Ecuador had three.\n\nThe result marked the first time that a host team has lost the opening game of the World Cup.\n\nThe partisan crowd was sent into stunned silence when Ecuador appeared to take the lead in the fifth minute at Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, around 50 kilometers north of Qatari capital Doha.\n\nValencia powered a header into the back of the net following Felix Torres' overhead kick, but the goal was disallowed after the former West Ham and Everton forward was ruled offside by the video assistant referee.\n\nValencia did not have to wait long for his next chance. The 33-year-old was awarded a penalty in the 15th minute when he was tripped by goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb, having been played through on goal by Sebastian Mendez.\n\nHe then calmly slotted his spot-kick into the bottom right corner after sending Al-Sheeb the wrong way.\n\nEcuador's all-time leading scorer was in inspired form and he doubled the lead just after the half hour by straining every muscle in his neck to thump a header past Al-Sheeb following Angelo Preciado's cross.\n\nQatar's best chance of the opening 45 minutes came moments before the first-half whistle when Almoez Ali sent a glancing header wide of the target connecting Hassan Al-Haydos' cross from the right flank.\n\nEcuador emerged from the interval again looking the more dangerous team in attack. Preciado sent a speculative 25-meter shot over the bar and Al-Sheeb kept out Romario Ibarra's attempt following an errant Bassam Al-Rawi pass.\n\nIt took Qatar until the hour mark to make their first convincing attacking move of the second half. Abdelkarim Hassan sent a dangerous cross into the box from the right wing and Pedro Miguel rose highest only to see his header sail just wide.\n\nScoring chances for both teams were few and far between thereafter as Ecuador were content to sit back and concede possession without ever looking in danger of letting their lead slip.\n\nQatar will face Senegal in their next match on Friday while Ecuador are scheduled to meet the Netherlands the same day.",

        "How many tour operators derive their core business from ecotourism? The answer is, less than 2% of the 4,794 travel and tour companies currently registered with the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry.\n\nIf so, should the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, or Tourism Malaysia for short, continue to promote ecotourism overseas? The answer is a resounding yes!\n\nThis is because ecotourism is closely associated with the natural environment and hospitable weather. A good indicator is the amount of land still under tropical forest cover.\n\nAt a forum on forests at the United Nations Headquarters in May this year, Malaysia reported that 55.31% or 18.27 million hectares of its total land area is under forest cover.\n\nAt times, we may complain about our hot and humid weather. But these pale in comparison with the biting cold in winter of some countries where one could die of hypothermia when immersed in icy cold water.\n\nThankfully, the waters around our shores are relatively warm throughout the year and foreign visitors have no qualms plunging into the sea for swimming or diving or indulging in beach activities.\n\nExcept for more rain during certain periods of the year with some gusts of strong wind, and occasional mild tremors, we are free of devastating typhoons, earthquakes and volcanoes.\n\nAs such, our kind weather, sandy beaches and tropical rainforests have drawn an average of 26 million foreigners a year from 2012 to 2019, and they thoroughly enjoyed our hospitality, facilities and amenities.\n\nIn 2019, the main activities of foreign tourists were shopping (91.2%), sightseeing in cities (90.9%), visiting historical sites (31.9%), museums (27.8%), islands and beaches (26.9%), theme parks (24.9%), entertainment and night life (23.4%) and swimming (22%).\n\nAs for islands, visitors could easily go by themselves, while some were brought there by tour operators. As for beaches, they are usually within walking distance and most guests prefer to swim safely in the hotel pool than the open sea, as swimmers could easily be swept far away from shore by rip currents.\n\nThe main activity for which leisure tourists need the service of tour operators is visiting the many national parks, and may include exploration of caves, where visitors may not just enter and exit as they like.\n\nOverall, the number of tourists that made use of tour operators for ecotourism services is less than 1% of the 26 million foreign tourists per year that came before the pandemic.\n\nIn fact, it was way below 260,000 even with the addition of domestic tourists, although there were 239.1 million domestic visitors making 332.4 million trips and spending RM103.2bil in 2019.\n\nThis is because the main purposes of domestic visitors were visiting relatives and friends (42.3%), shopping (35.4%), holiday, leisure and relaxation (9%), entertainment, attending special event and sports (4%) and medical treatment and wellness (4%).\n\nAnd their main expenditure components were shopping (37.8%), automotive fuel (15%), food and beverage (14.3%), visiting households (10.2%), accommodation (8.4%), transportation (6.2%), other activities (5%) and before the trip, package, entrance fees and tickets (3.1%).\n\nAlthough the numbers of domestic visitors and expenditures were huge, tour operators had little to gain from domestic tourism as the majority drove their own vehicles or used public transport, with RM15.48bil spent on automotive fuel alone in 2019.\n\nMore than 68% of domestic tourists lodged with relatives and friends. Those that stayed in hotels, apartments, homestays, chalets and rest houses mostly booked these paid accommodations directly, without the need to go through travel agencies.\n\nAs for visiting natural sites such as popular beaches, streams or waterfalls, these are not touristic but leisure activities, although such trips are counted in domestic tourism surveys by the Department of Statistics.\n\nMistakenly, local authorities and state governments have been using the term \"tourism\" too freely. Whenever new roads were built to reach remote mountain streams or waterfalls, they were touted as another tourism project.\n\nBut without facilities for overnight accommodation, all visitors are just excursionists and not tourists. And without a concessionaire to maintain cleanliness, the vicinity would soon be strewn with rubbish left behind by picnickers and mobile hawkers.\n\nIt would be disgraceful to tout ecotourism after many pristine sites in our jungles have been turned into garbage dumps infested with flies and rodents.\n\nWorse, visitors could be exposed to rat urine which causes leptospirosis that can lead to kidney damage, inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.\n\nWhen launching the Natural Resources Ecotourism Empowerment Programme in Kota Baru recently, Energy and National Resources Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan said the government aims to brand Malaysia as a \"Top of The Mind Ecotourism Destination of the World\".\n\nEcotourism has been bandied about for umpteenth time by many, but what exactly is ecotourism?\n\nAccording to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, ecotourism encompasses all nature-based forms of tourism in which the main motivation of the tourists is the observation and appreciation of nature as well as the traditional cultures prevailing in natural areas.\n\nAnd the International Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as responsible travel to natural areas that conserve the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education.\n\nBoth organisations mentioned traditional cultures and local people. In 2019, there were 210,611 aborigines known as Orang Asli in peninsular Malaysia.\n\nWill tourists get to see these natives' way of life, practised in harmony with their natural environment over the centuries? Or will visitors be witnessing indigenous people being displaced from their ancestral lands by greedy loggers and corrupt officials?\n\nI have a simple definition of ecotourism. As eco means nature-friendly or not harming the environment, ecotourism could simply be defined as nature-friendly tourism.\n\nIf so, all natural sites that are now being degraded or desecrated should not be promoted as ecotourism until harmful activities are stopped or reduced drastically.\n\nIn recent years, deforestation from logging resulted in massive flooding as rainwater was not absorbed by jungles, and huge quantities of debris from trees, shrubs and wood waste were swept downstream.\n\nRecently, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said his ministry had identified as many as 5,500 flood hotspots across the country.\n\nThe following day, Takiyuddin Hassan announced that a total of 186 forested and recreational areas at risk of suffering a water surge would be closed from November to January next year.\n\nIn any case, the majority of tour operators have little to gain or lose from ecotourism, as almost all visitors engaged in leisure or recreational activities at natural sites could make travel arrangements themselves.\n\nYS CHAN, Kuala Lumpur\n\n(YS Chan is the master trainer for Mesra Malaysia and Travel and Tours Enhancement Course and an Asean Tourism Master Trainer.

Whether we need to collaborate, we will decide later as we do not know it yet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will need to convene a (Barisan) supreme council meeting on this, but we need to cross the bridge first, then we decide.\n\n\u201cAs for parties in Sabah and Sarawak, we can work with them as they are also part of us,\u201d he added.\n\nIsmail Sabri was asked to comment on a remark by PAS secretary-general Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan that Perikatan Nasional was confident that it would form the Federal Government with another coalition, especially Barisan, after GE15.",

        "KOTA BARU: Once the salvation to decades of water woes in Kelantan, the use of underground water is threatening to sink some parts of the state, with experts warning of more floods as a result.\n\nAlthough barely seen by the naked eye, the ground settlement caused by the drawing of water could bring more floods, according to a land surveying expert.\n\nDr Yong Chien Zheng told The Star that his study on the ground movement in the state has found evidence of parts of the state sinking up to 4.22mm per year.\n\nThe study, titled Groundwater extraction-induced land subsidence: A geodetic strain rate study in Kelantan, Malaysia, was published in 2018.\n\nHe said although insufficient data made it difficult to pinpoint the main cause, there was a high correlation between subsidence \u2013 the sinking of land or buildings to a lower level \u2013 and groundwater extraction.\n\n\u201cThe current subsiding rate in Kelantan is very much like Jakarta before the 1970s. The growing demand for groundwater in the Indonesian city drove a massive groundwater extraction that led to increased subsidence rates.\n\n\u201cAs a result, about 40% of Jakarta is now below sea level.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want what happened in Jakarta to happen here, that\u2019s why I published a paper of my study, hoping that it will warn the state government about the use of groundwater,\u201d added Yong, a lecturer of surveying at University of Otago, New Zealand.\n\nSick of the constant cuts and murky teh tarik-like water, most Kelantanese have been turning to traditional ways of taking underground water or \u201cair boring\u201d as the locals call it in a combination of Malay and English words.\n\n\u201cBoring\u201d is the drilling process that allows for underground water extraction.\n\nYong said his study, which was conducted based on 17 years of GPS (Global Positioning System) data in 11 different locations, found that Kuala Krai had the highest subsidence rate of 4.22mm per year.\n\n\u201cEight out of 11 stations were subsiding and the result of my study was similar to another local research (by Assoc Prof Ami Hassan Din from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in 2015) who employed a different technique,\u201d he said, adding that he used data from 1999 until 2016.\n\nHe believes the demand in Kelantan would have significantly grown since 2010 due to industrial development and was expected to continue to grow.\n\nThis, he added, would lead to an increase in the subsidence rate.\n\n\u201cThe subsidence rate will go up due to the lack of a scientific approach to control the balance between groundwater usage and recharge rate. In the worst-case scenario, we can expect an acceleration of subsidence due to economic growth.\n\n\u201cHowever, this prediction is inconclusive without further data analysis,\u201d he said.\n\nYong said eventhough groundwater was a good alternative for clean water resources due to its easy accessibility and cost-effectiveness, a scientific extraction approach was needed to ensure sustainability.\n\n\u201cTokyo is a classic example of successful land subsidence mitigation with a restriction on groundwater pumping, which resulted in a ground uplift of 16cm with the cessation of land subsidence,\u201d he added.\n\nYong called on the state government to have a centralised authority to track total groundwater usage and to have written legislation and policy for groundwater management.\n\n\u201cThe main drawback of the study I did is the lack of groundwater table monitoring information at every production well, therefore it is less likely to provide a realistic physical connection of the vertical subsidence and well distribution.\n\n\u201cA denser GPS network in Kelantan with additional sensors can provide much more detailed information in monitoring the highly localised land subsidence activity,\u201d he said.\n\nOn July 28, Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the water woes in Kelantan were due to Air Kelantan Sdn Bhd\u2019s (AKSB) inability to govern and manage its finances, which caused it difficulties in providing quality treated water to the people of Kelantan.\n\nAKSB, he said, was having trouble developing water assets to meet growing demand, upgrading existing assets to increase margin reserves, meeting compliance with drinking water quality parameters, and implementing a pipe replacement programme to reduce the rate of non-revenue water (NRW).\n\nTuan Ibrahim said several measures were taken to resolve the water issues in Kelantan, including strengthening AKSB\u2019s financial position, upgrading and constructing new water treatment plants, and focusing on the pipe replacement programme.\n\nHydro-environmental specialist Datuk Dr Azuhan Mohamed, however, said no incidents of land sinking were reported in Kelantan.\n\nAzuhan, who retired as AKSB general manager earlier this month, said action had been taken to identify the sinking claims, but checks with the Mineral and Geoscience Department found no such incidents.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, there\u2019s none (land sinking in Kelantan).\n\n\u201cI am not sure which areas the study looked at. We tried to get more information from the Mineral and Geoscience Department, but as far as I know, there are no such incidents.\n\n\u201cThe study probably looked at some rural areas,\u201d he said when contacted.\n\nAzuhan said the rate of sinking recorded by the study was small and could have been caused by many other factors, such as soil loss due to heavy rains, soil compaction, underground mining, and the collapse of abandoned mines.\n\n\u201cThe small volume of groundwater extraction will not cause land sinking and if there was land sinking, the people in Kelantan would have complained about cracks on their houses or their stairs falling out,\u201d he said.\n\nAzuhan also denied any excessive underground water abstraction, adding that the groundwater only accounts for 24% of the total raw water abstracted by AKSB for the supply of treated water to its customers.\n\n\u201cMalaysia has an abundance of rainwater that will allow for the water to be recharged,\u201d he added.",

He was 90.\n\nThe news was confirmed by a family member, who revealed that Laitong (as he was more popularly known) died in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 4.\n\nLaitong, who was born in Guangzhou, China in 1932, moved to Malaysia in 1937 to join his family in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAs a child growing up in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown, Laitong gravitated towards a career in art, where drawings of giant elephants and huge trees were his earliest memories of his favourite subjects. In his later years, he would also return to themes surrounding nature.\n\nIn a pre-Merdeka environment, the young artist was among the few who benefited from the Wednesday Art Group in the 1950s in KL initiated by Englishman Peter Harris, then a school inspector and dedicated art teacher.\n\nAs one of Malaysia's most important public artworks, Laitong\u2019s 1962 mosaic mural series still proudly adorns Muzium Negara's outer wall.

If a painting does not evoke the need to suppose a world that continues, then it has failed,\" Laitong was quoted as saying in an interview with The Star in August, 1995.\n\nIn 1961, Laitong was granted a year-long scholarship to study at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, United States before going on to further his art education at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.\n\nLaitong also made local art history when, in 1962, he won the competition to design the large frontal murals for Muzium Negara (National Museum) in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHis murals at Muzium Negara were commissioned by the country\u2019s first prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and paid for by pioneer rubber magnate and philanthropist Datuk Lee Kong Chian in 1962 after the national competition.\n\nCheong Laitong's 'Image On Rhythm' (1964), an abstract painting that was included in the seminal 'GRUP' exhibition in KL in 1967.

In my early period as an artist, I was influenced by the East Coast Malay craftsmen who were making kites, songket, batik, fabrics, weaving, basketry, pots and silver. Those were my favourite painting subjects, so it fitted in nicely when I tried to design the murals,\" recalled Laitong when describing the design of his murals in the book Building Merdeka: Independence Architecture in Kuala Lumpur, 1957-1966.\n\nDuring those heady years in the 1960s, he joined the ranks of the pioneers of Malaysian art and began to paint and exhibit actively in KL and abroad, with his artistic inclinations leaning towards abstract expressionism.\n\nLaitong also shared a certain kinship with a group of artists of the era, including Syed Ahmad Jamal, Ibrahim Hussein, Yeoh Jin Leng and Abdul Latiff Mohidin.\n\n\u201cIt was a kinship that was forged by similar education backgrounds, preferred methods of work and shared aesthetic values. The approach adopted by these artists as to the purpose of art and methods of work, established the avant garde position of the 1960s in the context of modern art activity in Malaysia,\u201d wrote art critic and academic T.K.

In 1969 and 1979, he also won the first prize awards at Salon Malaysia (art competition).\n\nAfter his retirement from advertising, Laitong returned to exhibiting art in the 1990s, allowing a new generation to discover his legacy through retrospective shows interspersed with the artist's sporadic periods of painting, an obsession which remained until the last years of his life.\n\n\u201cWhen you start to paint, the painting will tell you what to do, you just carry on painting. Painting will develop your mind and dictate to you which direction you go. Sometimes, the painting would just stop halfway and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore, and you can\u2019t paint this anymore .... all paintings have life,\u201d he declared in an interview with The Star in July 2007.\n\nLaitong is survived by his wife and four children.",
        "FLOODS caused some RM6.1bil in losses nationwide in 2021, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). This included damage to homes, vehicles, business premises, agriculture, factories and public assets/infrastructure.\n\nThe losses to the latter (electrical systems, roads, bridges, drains, public buildings, etc) were the biggest of all categories at RM2bil (33%), while damage to homes was RM1.6bil (26%).\n\nSelangor was the worst hit overall, with about half of Malaysia\u2019s losses recorded in the state, the DOSM report stated.\n\nAs many as 55 people perished in the floods from December 2021 to January this year, said Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abd Latiff Ahmad. More than 120,000 residents were displaced.\n\nClimate change played a role. While east coast states such as Kelantan and Terengganu are used to and more ready for annual monsoon floods, west coast states such as Selangor are less expectant of such deluges, notes Serina Rahman, visiting fellow at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nSo last December, when Tropical Depression 29W (a mild typhoon) took an unexpected turn to the peninsula\u2019s west coast, it dumped unprecedented volumes of rainfall. From Dec 17, a four-day continuous downpour was equal to a month\u2019s worth of rainfall in the area.\n\nFour rivers in Selangor breached their banks and many single-storey homes in Taman Sri Muda (Shah Alam) were flooded to their rooftops.\n\nAt the same time, a flow of forest debris gushed down rivers from the Titiwangsa Mountain Range and wiped out parts of Hulu Langat \u2013 leaving barren patches of land, collapsed roads and destroyed bridges in its wake. Residents likened it to a tsunami, says Serina.\n\nFlood mitigation\n\nFloods in the country can be managed in a holistic, sustainable and inclusive manner with a stable government, according to economist Dr Muhammad Daaniyall Abd Rahman.\n\n\u201cWe need political stability so that the government can undertake large-scale flood alleviation measures,\u201d says Dr Muhammad Daaniyall, an economist at the Centre for Future Labour Market Studies in Putrajaya. \u2018(Flood mitigation projects) will be expedited to avoid the recurrence of severe floods,\u2019 said Ismail Sabri.\n\nMalaysia needs to develop flood resilience to adapt to climate change. In August, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced five major flood mitigation projects with an allocation of RM4.7bil under the 12th Malaysia Plan.\n\n\u201cAt the end of last year (2021), major floods occurred in Selangor such as in Shah Alam, Hulu Langat and so on. With these flood mitigation projects we can avoid major floods,\u201d he said when officiating at the Keluarga Malaysia Aspirations Tour (AKM) of Selangor.\n\n\u201cThis effort will be expedited to avoid the recurrence of severe floods that affect the well-being of the population, and the economy of the state and country.\u201d\n\nIn September, the prime minister announced that seven flood mitigation projects worth RM1.3bil are in the works for Kedah, also under the 12th Malaysia Plan. These projects are slated for Sungai Pendang, Sungai Kedah/Anak Bukit, Kuala Pegang and Bandar Jitra Selatan.\n\nThe government under the leadership of Ismail Sabri has developed a long-term flood mitigation plan from 2023 until 2030 which will cost RM15bil.\n\nOn Oct 7, when tabling Budget 2023, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said the flood alleviation projects include the construction of a dual-function reservoir costing almost RM2bil along Sungai Klang and Sungai Rasau in Selangor \u2013 to overcome floods and to store raw water.\n\nSabo dams costing RM562mil will be built at 46 locations under Budget 2023 to reduce the risks of debris and mud floods from deforestation. A sabo dam, also called check dam, is a dam-like structure with many gaps, like a giant sieve. It\u2019s designed to slow down, but not retain, water gushing down from mountains and to trap logs, huge rocks and debris tumbling downwards.\n\nAfter chairing a National Water Council meeting in July, Ismail Sabri revealed that a sabo dam is being built in Yan (Kedah), and will be built in Baling (Kedah) and Janda Baik (Pahang) soon to avoid repeats of the devastating water surge floods that hit these places.\n\nFor 2023, Tengku Zafrul added that RM400mil will be channelled to the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) to ensure a state of preparedness to assist promptly in the event of floods. The government has also set aside RM100mil under the National Disaster Aid Fund.\n\nAs Parliament was dissolved on Oct 10, Budget 2023 will probably need to be tabled again in Parliament after the elections.\n\nHowever, it remains a clear statement of the government\u2019s serious intentions to tackle floods.\n\nOn Oct 29, Ismail Sabri reiterated this by announcing that RM1.8bil would be allocated for flood mitigation and seashore erosion works in Pahang.\n\nExperts point out that tackling floods also involves non-structural measures such as better flood warning systems, coordination between the district, state and federal authorities for faster emergency response, and improved management of forest slopes.\n\nStructural measures involve not only better drainage systems and flood retention ponds but also urban design \u2013 for example using grass for permeable parking lots and household/commercial rainwater harvesting tanks. The aim is to increase absorption of rainfall, and to reduce rapid run-off into drains.\n\nPersonal items damaged and unsalvageable after the flood. \u2013 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nProtecting livelihood\n\nDr Muhammad Daaniyall points out that another aspect that the government is looking at is the protection of people\u2019s livelihoods.\n\nFlexible social protection schemes, such as insurance, to deal with disaster risks will be studied by the government.\n\nThe objective is to reduce post-disaster liabilities and to reduce the financial burden of the government by getting the corporate sector involved, he says.\n\nTo tackle floods, the country needs an integrated management ecosystem and political will.\n\nIt will be about the involvement and coordination of various government agencies, the private sector and local communities, he adds.\n\nTo realise both the short and long term goals of flood mitigation, Malaysia needs a stable government, says Dr Muhammad Daaniyall.\n\nThis will ensure that flood management can be achieved in a holistic, sustainable and inclusive manner so that the welfare and safety of the people will be protected.",

They have ignored the line, for sure.\n\nThe election is over.

Malaysia needs to get back to work and brace itself for a tough 2023. There\u2019s simply no time for unproductive politics.\n\nIt\u2019s better for the new Federal Government to dedicate itself to making Malaysia a country we can all be proud of, with the rest of the world viewing us favourably.\n\nLeave the dogmatic religious hardliners alone. Stop talking of banning PAS or arresting its leaders, as we will only create martyrs of them, an because, ultimately, it\u2019s more important that the unity government proves its mettle.\n\nIf needed, appoint good PAS lawmakers who can contribute to their positions. Why not? There is good talent in all parties, and on both sides of the divide, too.\n\nLet bipartisan politics be a part of a developing, mature democracy, where substance matters more than form.\n\nAs Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu said in The Art of War, \u201cKeep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer\u201d.\n\nIf the unity government is genuine, let it be an inclusive government.\n\nThose of us who know Anwar will concur that he doesn\u2019t give up on anyone. He will meet everyone, including those who\u2019ve bad-mouthed him, to win them over.\n\nHis policy has always been that if he can\u2019t have them aligned with him, he would want them to, at least, not oppose him.

        "PETALING JAYA: While cybersecurity may not be a foolproof solution to online financial scams, experts say there are a few extra measures that can be taken by banks to beef up protection.\n\nCybersecurity expert and LE Global Services Bhd managing director Fong Choong-Fook said the most effective way to protect consumers is awareness, as at this juncture there is no effective way to fight online crime with technology.\n\nHowever, he noted there are a few extra protection measures which could be adopted by banks, such as moving away from SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) for authentication of transactions.\n\nThis is one of the measures that Bank Negara is effecting in its stepped up efforts to fight online financial crime (see \u201cPutting the brakes on cybercrime\u201d on P5).\n\n\u201cMoving out of OTP is good because currently all the malware is trying to read SMS texts. As long as we move away from SMS, the risks will be less,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said some banks have already adopted the more secure Soft Token application for authentication; this is a software-based security token that will generate a single-use login PIN (personal identification number) instead of an OTP for transactions.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for hackers to hijack the soft token application, he said, though he believes new forms of attacks by scammers will emerge when the OTP system is abolished.\n\nHe said banks could also do pattern analyses of user transactions, so unusual transactions differing from the usual pattern would trigger checks.\n\nHowever, he conceded that this is easier said than done.\n\nAlthough hotlines could be abused by imposters and disrupters, he said it is still important for financial institutions to have an effective hotline system through which consumers can reach out quickly.\n\n\u201cThe other thing the bank needs to do is identify mule accounts because scammers transfer their stolen money out to mule accounts,\u201d he said.\n\nIf banks could quickly identify mule accounts at a very early stage, they could at least freeze those accounts and attempt to recover the money, he added.\n\nHe said it is important for banks to collaborate closely and share intelligence because illegal funds are likely to be transferred from one institution to another.\n\nConsumers must do their part too. It is essential to ensure devices are protected with anti-virus software to prevent malware getting through to phones and computers, he said.\n\nConcurring with Fong, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia\u2019s Prof Datuk Dr Mohamed Ridza Wahiddin said, from a technological point of view, an SMS-based OTP system is the least secure of all authentication methods.\n\n\u201cIt is susceptible to a \u2018man-in-the-middle\u2019 attack as well as social engineering. Advanced countries are now considering Fast Identity Online [Fido] to replace the former,\u201d said the chairman of the Information Technology & Computer Science Discipline at Akademi Sains Malaysia.\n\n(A \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack is when a scammer positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.)\n\nHe also agrees that it comes down to users themselves to keep safe: \u201cEnd-users must increase their awareness of phishing and social engineering threats, and consequently take action on how to alleviate them,\u201d he said.\n\nFederation of Malaysian Consumer Associations (Fomca) chief executive officer T. Saravanan said banks should have beefed up security a long time ago.\n\n\u201cBank Negara\u2019s intervention shows that there are some weaknesses in the security, such as transaction authorisation codes or OTPs, blocking transactions and others,\u201d he said.\n\nBanks are generating income from people\u2019s money, so their number one priority should be to protect their money.\n\n\u201cBanks need to invest more in security improvements,\u201d he said, adding that Fomca agrees with and supports Bank Negara\u2019s guidelines.\n\nHe said banks should also play an important role in educating their customers about banking security.\n\n\u201cMany elderly customers and rural consumers are overlooked as they are not digitally savvy and eventually fall into traps,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope banks will improve their customer service hotline and (take) quick action to resolve these consumer issues.\u201d\n\nHe added that banks should do away with unnecessary advertisements when customers call their service lines, as they waste a lot of time.\n\nMeanwhile, to avoid falling victim to scams, the Consumers Association of Penang\u2019s (CAP) senior education officer, NV Subbarow, said consumers need to be wary of online purchases.\n\n\u201cWe would advise them to buy from legitimate online shopping platforms and avoid buying things from social media,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that if anything goes wrong with a legitimate shopping platform transaction, it is possible for the consumer to take the case to the relevant authorities, such as the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry or the Tribunal for Consumer Claims.\n\n\u201cIf a person is scammed through social media, the person has to lodge a police report for investigation first and, if it is really a scam, the shop or person might not have existed at all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Star\u2019s front page story yesterday reported that the government is looking at a comprehensive law to bring online businesses under closer control.\n\nA task force is conducting a review to pave the way for a new licensing mechanism, with existing regulations to be amended.\n\nDeputy Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister, Datuk Rosol Wahid, said the ministry is mulling a special licence for online businesses to protect consumers from scams.",

They need funding for the best education but Lim stopped the funding for the college,\" he said.\n\nAzmin added that Perikatan Nasional chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin ordered the Finance Ministry to resume channelling funds to TAR UC after he was appointed as the prime minister in 2020.\n\nLim, who is DAP chairman, denied this and threw back the word \"traitor\" at Azmin in Butterworth on Sunday (Nov 13).\n\n\"He is a traitor, so he can say anything he wants,\" Lim told reporters.\n\nHe said Azmin needed to show proof before calling him \"langsi\" and threatened to sue.\n\nDenying that he \"chased down companies\" for taxes, Lim said he introduced many tax incentives to boost the economy, including a tax reduction from 18% to 17% for small and medium enterprises.",

        "PETALING JAYA: DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng must clarify his relationship with the private company that wanted to land the Penang International Airport (PIA) expansion deal, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong.\n\nThe Transport Minister said although the expansion plan for PIA was supposed to have been implemented in 2018, Lim should have considered the role of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which is a government-linked company.\n\n\u201cHowever, once Pakatan formed the government, the costs of the upgrade and expansion were changed to the private financing initiative (PFI) instead.\n\n\u201cWhy did Lim, during his tenure as Finance Minister, choose the PFI model instead of proceeding with the project under MAHB?\u201d asked Dr Wee in a Facebook post yesterday.\n\nHe revealed that on Dec 3, 2018, when Pakatan ruled Putrajaya, a private company allegedly wrote to Lim as the Finance Minister, Anthony Loke as Transport Transport, and Chow Kon Yeow as Penang Chief Minister.\n\n\u201cThis letter made clear that it intended to take over the operation of PIA from MAHB within 30 years.\n\n\u201cFor this, the company said it was prepared to bear the cost of RM1.2bil to expand the airport and raise its passenger capacity to 15 million yearly.\n\n\u201cAt that time, MAHB\u2019s market cap had breached RM15bil, more than enough to bear the cost of PIA\u2019s expansion and upgrades. The private company planned for 15 million yearly passenger capacity, instead of the 12 million when approved under Barisan Nasional.\n\n\u201cWhat this implies is there would be more land acquisition needed, including that of a nearby school.\n\n\u201cWhy had Lim insisted on awarding this project to a private company compared to MAHB, which is already more than capable of financing the project, with the experience to run the facility?\u201d asked Dr Wee.\n\nHe further pointed out that Lim himself praised the initiative to upgrade PIA under Budget 2018.\n\n\u201cLogically, if Pakatan had proceeded with the PIA expansion under Budget 2018 as tabled by the Barisan government, how could I have delayed the project?\n\n\u201cIf the project had been allowed to start in 2018, how would I have postponed it in 2020 when I was Transport Minister?\n\n\u201cBack then, MAHB had a 2018 after-tax profit of RM727.3mil (and RM537mil in 2019), with cash reserves of nearly RM1.5bil, while its market cap was more than RM16bil.\n\n\u201cNot only does MAHB have the reserves to expand PIA, the expenditure could also be offset by the collection of passenger service charges subsequently. How can this former Finance Minister fail to understand this concept?\u201d Dr Wee said, adding that Lim should clarify his relationship with the said private company so that the public could have the full picture.\n\nIn a separate Facebook post, Dr Wee also continued to defend the northern alignment of Section C of ECRL, that starts from Mentakab to Port Klang via Bentong and Gombak, saying that this original proposal meets all the criteria for project sustainability.\n\n\u201cWhen Barisan came in and restarted the project in April 2021, the Transport Ministry and MRL Sdn Bhd, the project owner, held 37 engagement sessions with 17 Selangor state government agencies before we finally decided on the original northern alignment, at the same unit cost, with lower social and environment impact,\u201d said Dr Wee.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the improved northern alignment during my tenure is being kept at RM50.27bil after negotiations with the contractor to bring more benefit to Selangor, especially with the building of many stations (five stations in Selangor) to bring greater economic spillover in Gombak, Serendah and Port Klang, and with extensions all the way to Westport and Northport.\u201d\n\nDr Wee was responding to former Transport Minister Anthony Loke, who claimed in a ceramah in Bentong on Thursday that he wasn\u2019t responsible for switching ECRL\u2019s northern alignment to a southern one that passes near Seremban and Putrajaya.",

I didn't know he was a conman at the time.\n\nGobind: Najib was the prime minister at that time.\n\nZarul Ahmad: Yes.\n\nGobind: A PM who was the head of BN (Barisan Nasional).\n\nZarul Ahmad: Yes\n\nGobind: Which was the opposing party of the government at that time.\n\nZarul Ahmad: Yes\n\nGobind: Which was the party that would want evidence to fix up Lim Guan Eng, if possible, correct?

And by your evidence they were attacking Lim Guan Eng too. If that is the case you wouldn't have approached them, bribed them in order to save your project, or save Lim Guan Eng.

We now account for more than half of all healthcare travellers coming into Penang,\u201d Wee said at the recent launch.\n\nPenang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said such public-private partnerships created a multitude of opportunities for locals, especially in the job sector.\n\nIt leads to the upskilling of healthcare workers and support personnel, while generating immense spillover effects for the economy.\n\nCiting data from the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC), Chow said the state commands 61% of the country\u2019s entire medical tourism revenue, attracting direct spending of RM567mil.\n\nEqually beneficial is indirect spending on upstream and downstream activities such as hospitality, local services, retail and transport.\n\nFor next year, the figure was expected to exceed RM2bil, he said.\n\n\u201cWith the commitment to quality healthcare from players like Island Hospital, Penang is fast gaining recognition as a leading medical destination on par with others in the region.\n\n\u201cWe have long been renowned for our hospitality and food. But now our healthcare services and expertise is another attraction,\u201d he said.\n\nChow said having such facilities in the state would also lure back young medical professionals who left for opportunities elsewhere.\n\nRegaining this lost talent would have positive effects across various industries.\n\nHe was joined by former Penang chief minister Lim Guan Eng, Deputy Chief Minister II Dr P. Ramasamy, Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce executive advisor Tan Sri Tan Kok Ping and hospital directors for the launch.\n\nThe Peel Wing adds 14 operating theatres and 300 beds.\n\nCombined with 300 in the existing block, renamed the Macalister Wing, Island is the state\u2019s first 600-bed private hospital.\n\n\u201cThe expansion gives us the infrastructure and expertise to provide a full range of medical and surgical patient services from health screening to cutting-edge oncological therapies, advanced minimally invasive general and cardiothoracic surgery, robotic-assisted surgeries and AI-guided rehabilitation,\u201d Wee continued.\n\nIsland is the only hospital in the northern region to provide renal transplants.\n\nNew services include nuclear medicine imaging with a Siemens Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner, radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery using the Varian TrueBeam system with HyperArc, and a rehabilitation and physiotherapy centre using the AI-guided DAVID Solution.\n\nDentistry also debuts at the Peel Wing, joining the existing dialysis, gastroenterology and endoscopy, health screening, internal medicine, ophthalmology, plastic surgery and clinical oncology departments.\n\nBoth wings are connected via a 120m air-conditioned underpass walkway. There is also a parking block with 800 bays.\n\nWee said the expansion also marks a metamorphosis into Island Medical City, a first-of-its-kind medical hub.\n\nTo mark the Peel Wing\u2019s opening, the hospital will run a series of community workshops and programmes.\n\nIt is also giving complimentary full cancer profile tests to all Premier Health Screening packages purchased online.",

        "KUALA LUMPUR: The investigation paper (IP) of a RM19mil cheating case against a businessman, G. Gnanaraja, has been classified as \u201cno further action\u201d (NFA), the Sessions Court here was told.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor (DPP) Mahadi Abdul Jumaat disclosed the matter at the court yesterday during the corruption trial of former Penang chief minister Lim Guan Eng linked to the Penang Undersea Tunnel Project. Court day: Lim arriving at the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex near Jalan Duta. \u2014 Bernama\n\nFor the record, Gnanaraja is one of the prosecution witnesses in Lim\u2019s trial. Gnanaraja was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court on April 3, 2019, with three charges of cheating Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd (CZCSB) director Datuk Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli of RM19mil.\n\nHe was alleged to have deceived Zarul Ahmad into believing that he could help him close the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigation against him, linked to the same project.\n\nChecks on the MACC website found that Gnanaraja was imposed a fine of RM230,000 over a charge under Section 218 (1)(A) of the Companies Act 2016, on Dec 23, 2020.\n\nIt was understood that the charge under the Companies Act was an alternative charge that the businessman pleaded guilty to instead of the cheating charge.\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s proceedings, Mahadi said the IP has been classified as NFA and the prosecution team conducting the case against Lim does not have the report (on the Shah Alam case).\n\nHe clarified this when Lim\u2019s lead counsel Gobind Singh Deo said the defence would be filing contempt proceedings against the prosecution for allegedly contravening a court order issued on Sept 29 for the MACC forensic department investigation officer Wan Mohd Firdaus Wan Yusof to produce an image copy of the contents of a phone belonging to Zarul Ahmad.\n\nThe court order is also for the prosecution to furnish details of the report prepared for the Shah Alam court case, which contained a WhatsApp conversation between Zarul Ahmad and Gnanaraja.\n\nGobind\u2019s contempt claim arose following his cross-examination of Wan Mohd Firdaus yesterday, whereby the latter testified that he was unable to obtain the details sought by the defence team.\n\nWan Mohd Firdaus explained that while he had made an effort to secure the details, he had trouble trying to obtain them as the defence team did not provide the full forensic report number for the Shah Alam court case.\n\nGobind then queried why this was a problem as DPP Nik Haslinie Hashim, who is a member of the prosecution conducting the case against Lim, also happened to be the same prosecutor involved in the Shah Alam case against Gnanaraja.\n\n\u201cHow can the prosecution tell the witness that they don\u2019t have the information? I want action to be taken. They are hiding documents from us. We will file a committal application as the prosecution is suppressing evidence in the case,\u201d said Gobind.\n\nAt this juncture, Mahadi objected to the allegation and argued that the WhatsApp conversation was not relevant to the present case against Lim.\n\nMahadi also claimed that Lim\u2019s lawyers were previously involved in various bids to obtain multiple documents done in stages that allegedly delayed the trial.\n\nThe prosecutor then said the defence should file a formal application and list all the documents that they are seeking.\n\nGobind then denied they were trying to delay proceedings, contending that the defence has the right to file any application for further documents or evidence at any stage of proceedings due to any new developments that may arise.\n\nLim, 61, is facing an amended charge of using his position as Penang Chief Minister to solicit RM3.3mil in bribes as an inducement to assist Consortium Zenith BUCG Sdn Bhd (CZBUCG) owner, Zarul Ahmad, to secure the project worth RM6,341,383,702.\n\nIn the second amended charge, Lim is accused of soliciting a bribe of 10% of the profit from the company as gratification to secure the project.\n\nLim, who is DAP chairman, also faces another two charges of causing two plots of land worth RM208.8mil belonging to the Penang government to be disposed of to two companies linked to the state\u2019s undersea tunnel project.\n\nThe trial before Judge Azura Alwi continues on Nov 23. \u2014 Bernama",
        "GEORGE TOWN: The Tanjong parliamentary seat, now vacated by Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow after his move to Batu Kawan, has a colourful history with some of Malaysia\u2019s epic electoral battles taking place.\n\nFor now, the chase for the 13 parliamentary seats in Penang is going smoothly, both via physical ceramah and on social media, with big guns from Pakatan Harapan, Barisan Nasional and Perikatan Nasional coming out with guns blazing.But the Tanjong seat will be among those that are closely watched.\n\nIt brings to mind the fiery battle between DAP stalwart Lim Kit Siang and Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon in 1986.\n\nThat was when Kit Siang \u201cparachuted\u201d into the seat to try and wrest the seat away from Koh in what was dubbed the \u201cBattle for Tanjong\u201d.\n\nKit Siang won the keenly-contested match and managed to retain the seat again four years later, which was dubbed Tanjong 2.\n\nThis time around, DAP won 14 state seats to deny Barisan a two-thirds majority in the state assembly.Kit Siang also captured the Padang Kota state seat at the expense of then chief minister Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu.\n\nBuoyed by the splendid performance, Kit Siang went into battle full of confidence and vigour for the \u201cTanjong Three\u201d fight in the Tanjong Bungah state seat in 1995.\n\nHe portrayed himself as the \u201cRobocop\u201d who would save all Penangites and lead Penang to greater heights. Posters showing Kit Siang in a Robocop outfit were plastered all over the island.\n\nBut the party\u2019s strategy backfired spectacularly. DAP was dealt a crushing blow when not only Kit Siang was toppled by Koh, but the party only managed to win one state seat in Batu Lancang in that election.\n\nFast forward to today, the battle for Tanjong is shaping up to be a real thriller with two women candidates in Tan Kim Nee (MCA) and Kit Siang\u2019s daughter Hui Ying (DAP) in the fray.\n\nTan, 38, has been with the MCA for the past 17 years while Lim, 59, is a one-term senator.\n\nAlthough both Tan and Hui Ying will be contesting in GE15 for the first time, the latter has more pedigree as she comes from a famous family in the Malaysian political scene. Her older brother is Guan Eng, the former finance minister and former Penang chief minister.\n\nGerakan\u2019s (Perikatan Nasional) H\u2019ng Khoon Leng, 58, is the dark horse in the fight.\n\nOne thing is for sure, it won\u2019t be a shoo-in for anyone.\n\n\u201cPenang lang (Penangites) are quite rebellious and unpredictable. You can\u2019t predict which way they are going to vote,\u201d said Chiew, a trader at the Esplanade.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are also quite loyal. We don\u2019t easily forget a good leader.\u201d\n\nAnother Tanjong voter, KK Loh, said nothing could be taken for granted in GE15.\n\n\u201cAlthough this constituency has been a DAP stronghold, voters may want a change after so many years. I\u2019m keeping my options open,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of Sept 15, the Tanjong parliamentary seat has 52,859 voters with the majority being Chinese at 43,019 voters, followed by Indians (5,990), Malays (5,451) and others (399).",

        "GEORGE TOWN: The Tanjong parliamentary seat, now vacated by Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow after his move to Batu Kawan, has a colourful history with some of Malaysia\u2019s epic electoral battles taking place.\n\nFor now, the chase for the 13 parliamentary seats in Penang is going smoothly, both via physical ceramah and on social media, with big guns from Pakatan Harapan, Barisan Nasional and Perikatan Nasional coming out with guns blazing.But the Tanjong seat will be among those that are closely watched.\n\nIt brings to mind the fiery battle between DAP stalwart Lim Kit Siang and Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon in 1986.\n\nThat was when Kit Siang \u201cparachuted\u201d into the seat to try and wrest the seat away from Koh in what was dubbed the \u201cBattle for Tanjong\u201d.\n\nKit Siang won the keenly-contested match and managed to retain the seat again four years later, which was dubbed Tanjong 2.\n\nThis time around, DAP won 14 state seats to deny Barisan a two-thirds majority in the state assembly.Kit Siang also captured the Padang Kota state seat at the expense of then chief minister Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu.\n\nBuoyed by the splendid performance, Kit Siang went into battle full of confidence and vigour for the \u201cTanjong Three\u201d fight in the Tanjong Bungah state seat in 1995.\n\nHe portrayed himself as the \u201cRobocop\u201d who would save all Penangites and lead Penang to greater heights. Posters showing Kit Siang in a Robocop outfit were plastered all over the island.\n\nBut the party\u2019s strategy backfired spectacularly. DAP was dealt a crushing blow when not only Kit Siang was toppled by Koh, but the party only managed to win one state seat in Batu Lancang in that election.\n\nFast forward to today, the battle for Tanjong is shaping up to be a real thriller with two women candidates in Tan Kim Nee (MCA) and Kit Siang\u2019s daughter Hui Ying (DAP) in the fray.\n\nTan, 38, has been with the MCA for the past 17 years while Lim, 59, is a one-term senator.\n\nAlthough both Tan and Hui Ying will be contesting in GE15 for the first time, the latter has more pedigree as she comes from a famous family in the Malaysian political scene. Her older brother is Guan Eng, the former finance minister and former Penang chief minister.\n\nGerakan\u2019s (Perikatan Nasional) H\u2019ng Khoon Leng, 58, is the dark horse in the fight.\n\nOne thing is for sure, it won\u2019t be a shoo-in for anyone.\n\n\u201cPenang lang (Penangites) are quite rebellious and unpredictable. You can\u2019t predict which way they are going to vote,\u201d said Chiew, a trader at the Esplanade.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are also quite loyal.

Chow said the premium charged would be based on the land value.\n\n\u201cIf the land is worth RM1mil, the premium to extend it for another 99 years will be RM100,000. \u201cThis is based on the value of the land and does not include any properties built on the land.\n\n\u201cIt is the same for industrial land. Most have 60-year leasehold periods and many of these have 10 to 20 years left.\n\n\u201cThe industries can extend the lease for between 30 and 99 years,\u201d he said.\n\nOn a separate matter, Chow said the state government was fortunate to have dedicated civil servants with integrity and commitment in ensuring that policies would be implemented successfully.\n\n\u201cTo appreciate their contributions, we have approved a Bantuan Khas Kewangan payment at the end of the year, which is equivalent to half a month\u2019s salary or a minimum of RM1,200.\n\n\u201cThis payment involves 3,920 state civil servants amounting to RM6.13mil. \u201cAll payments will be made in December,\u201d he said.",

Penang is the only state whose constitution explicitly restricts the chief minister to just two terms.\n\nThe hint over the replacement could come from where candidates are fielded in the state elections.\n\nPolitical observers expect Chow to say goodbye to Parliament (he was Tanjong MP before dissolution) and focus entirely on being the chief minister.\n\nThe Chinese press have reported that Penang DAP secretary Lim Hui Ying, 59, may be fielded in the Air Putih state seat, which was previously held by her older brother Guan Eng, the DAP chairman.\n\nThis would free Guan Eng to focus on his Bagan parliamentary seat.\n\nHui Ying\u2019s name is being bandied about as the first woman chief executive of a state.\n\nHowever, the much younger Bukit Mertajam MP Steven Sim Chee Keong, who is 40, is also looking to be a strong candidate.\n\nObservers are waiting to see him taken off DAP\u2019s list of parliamentary candidates, which would be an indication of his elevation in the state.\n\nHe is regarded as a strong supporter of Guan Eng and could be groomed to be a potential chief minister beyond 2028.\n\n\u201cDAP has an unwritten rule that except for state party chairman and secretary-general, all other members will only contest in either a state or parliamentary seat. However, there are exceptions,\u201d said a party insider.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t see Sim contesting in Bukit Mertajam, then we can expect him to be sent to the state assembly later.\u201d\n\nShould this happen, Sim, the party national organising secretary, could aim for the Berapit seat on mainland Penang.\n\nDuring Pakatan Harapan\u2019s 22-month stint in the Federal Government, he was deputy youth and sports minister.\n\nThe computer science graduate of Universiti Malaya, who worked for three years in a multinational corporation before becoming a full-time politician, is popular in his parliamentary constituency where he is known for his outreach work since 2013.\n\nAnother party insider felt it would be a waste if Sim is taken away from Parliament.\n\n\u201cHe has good Putrajaya experience.

        "PETALING JAYA: DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng must clarify his relationship with the private company that wanted to land the Penang International Airport (PIA) expansion deal, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong.\n\nThe Transport Minister said although the expansion plan for PIA was supposed to have been implemented in 2018, Lim should have considered the role of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which is a government-linked company.\n\n\u201cHowever, once Pakatan formed the government, the costs of the upgrade and expansion were changed to the private financing initiative (PFI) instead.\n\n\u201cWhy did Lim, during his tenure as Finance Minister, choose the PFI model instead of proceeding with the project under MAHB?\u201d asked Dr Wee in a Facebook post yesterday.\n\nHe revealed that on Dec 3, 2018, when Pakatan ruled Putrajaya, a private company allegedly wrote to Lim as the Finance Minister, Anthony Loke as Transport Transport, and Chow Kon Yeow as Penang Chief Minister.\n\n\u201cThis letter made clear that it intended to take over the operation of PIA from MAHB within 30 years.\n\n\u201cFor this, the company said it was prepared to bear the cost of RM1.2bil to expand the airport and raise its passenger capacity to 15 million yearly.\n\n\u201cAt that time, MAHB\u2019s market cap had breached RM15bil, more than enough to bear the cost of PIA\u2019s expansion and upgrades. The private company planned for 15 million yearly passenger capacity, instead of the 12 million when approved under Barisan Nasional.\n\n\u201cWhat this implies is there would be more land acquisition needed, including that of a nearby school.\n\n\u201cWhy had Lim insisted on awarding this project to a private company compared to MAHB, which is already more than capable of financing the project, with the experience to run the facility?\u201d asked Dr Wee.\n\nHe further pointed out that Lim himself praised the initiative to upgrade PIA under Budget 2018.\n\n\u201cLogically, if Pakatan had proceeded with the PIA expansion under Budget 2018 as tabled by the Barisan government, how could I have delayed the project?\n\n\u201cIf the project had been allowed to start in 2018, how would I have postponed it in 2020 when I was Transport Minister?\n\n\u201cBack then, MAHB had a 2018 after-tax profit of RM727.3mil (and RM537mil in 2019), with cash reserves of nearly RM1.5bil, while its market cap was more than RM16bil.\n\n\u201cNot only does MAHB have the reserves to expand PIA, the expenditure could also be offset by the collection of passenger service charges subsequently. How can this former Finance Minister fail to understand this concept?\u201d Dr Wee said, adding that Lim should clarify his relationship with the said private company so that the public could have the full picture.\n\nIn a separate Facebook post, Dr Wee also continued to defend the northern alignment of Section C of ECRL, that starts from Mentakab to Port Klang via Bentong and Gombak, saying that this original proposal meets all the criteria for project sustainability.\n\n\u201cWhen Barisan came in and restarted the project in April 2021, the Transport Ministry and MRL Sdn Bhd, the project owner, held 37 engagement sessions with 17 Selangor state government agencies before we finally decided on the original northern alignment, at the same unit cost, with lower social and environment impact,\u201d said Dr Wee.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the improved northern alignment during my tenure is being kept at RM50.27bil after negotiations with the contractor to bring more benefit to Selangor, especially with the building of many stations (five stations in Selangor) to bring greater economic spillover in Gombak, Serendah and Port Klang, and with extensions all the way to Westport and Northport.\u201d\n\nDr Wee was responding to former Transport Minister Anthony Loke, who claimed in a ceramah in Bentong on Thursday that he wasn\u2019t responsible for switching ECRL\u2019s northern alignment to a southern one that passes near Seremban and Putrajaya.",

        "POLITICS can be stressful and politicians tend to age fast but Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow has aged well.\n\nHis waistline is thicker but he still has a full head of hair and a glowing complexion.\n\nThe stress is set to intensify in the coming months amid speculation of an early general election.\n\nChow, 63, will need to win the next general election with a strong mandate in order to continue occupying the hot seat on the 28th floor of Komtar in Penang.\n\nHis government had previously implied it may not come along in the general election but all the feel-good statements coming from him of late seem to suggest otherwise.\n\nHe recently presented the state's report card to much fanfare, with full-page advertisements in the print media and calling on the people to \"Love Penang\".\n\nIt was a glowing report, claiming that 90% of Pakatan Harapan's manifesto had been fulfilled \u2013 from the green policy to affordable housing, foreign investments and welfare programmes.\n\nThe undersea tunnel, once a centrepiece project, appears to have been swept under the carpet. Chow seems more interested in highlighting policies and projects that people can relate to.\n\nBut is it really all sunshine and everything nice in Penang?\n\nThe people who live and work in Penang would be in a better position to answer that.\n\nThe thing is, Pakatan's hold over the Penang electorate has more to do with perception than dry statistics.\n\nPenang is the only state with a Chinese head of government and this is a non-negotiable factor for the Chinese voters.\n\nNon-Malays feel that they are treated more equally under this government. The fact that this is the only state government with an Indian deputy CM says so much.\n\nBut the general populace like Chow.\n\nPenang's Mr Nice Guy is naturally humble, mild-mannered and approachable. He is not associated with any scandal and gets good press because he treats the media with respect.\n\nEven Penang Malays, who were so hostile towards his predecessor, have nice things to say about him.\n\nWill all this add up to a second term for Chow?\n\nDAP won all the 19 state seats it contested in 2018 while Parti Amanah Negara won two and PKR 14.\n\nWhile DAP looks set for another clean sweep, its partners are less assured of a repeat performance \u2013 going by the outcome of the Johor and Melaka elections.\n\nThings could get problematic for Chow if DAP\u2019s Pakatan partners do not deliver.\n\nDAP politics in Penang is a balancing act between those aligned to Chow and those groomed by his predecessor Lim Guan Eng.\n\nThere are undercurrents and a dark horse is waiting in the wings.\n\nSteven Sim, the Bukit Mertajam MP and a former deputy minister, has emerged as a potential chief minister.\n\nSim is an acolyte of Lim Guan Eng. He was the former chief minister\u2019s shadow in the run-up to the national party election and it came across as a signal that he was someone to watch.\n\nHe did remarkably well in the party polls, coming in at No. 7 and pipping his boss Guan Eng who took the No. 8 spot.\n\nHe was subsequently made national organising secretary, which is seen as a precursor to the coveted secretary-general post.\n\nSim, 40, is widely expected to contest a state seat in the general election and anything is possible if he plays it right. For a start, he needs to stop going around with a professional photographer in tow when he helps the needy because it takes the sincerity out of the good act.\n\nWhen reporters asked Chow about Sim's prospects for the top post, Chow responded with a zinger: \"Who knows, Penang may have the first female chief minister.\"\n\nHe was, of course, referring to Senator Lim Hui Ying, the younger sister of Guan Eng.\n\nWas Chow telling one dark horse not to be too presumptuous and that there is another dark horse with bigger cables?\n\nHui Ying's rapid rise in the party has not gone unnoticed. She is the state party secretary and is arguably the most powerful woman in Penang DAP today.\n\nThe kopitiam chatter is that she may contest in Air Putih, the state seat currently held by her brother.\n\nTalk that she may one day become Penang chief minister began when Guan Eng was still running the state government. It started as a joke but the joke seems to have become a possibility.\n\nIt would, however, be a mistake to underestimate Chow. The Kuala Lumpur-born Chow planted roots in Penang after graduating from Universiti Sains Malaysia in the 1980s.\n\nHe understands Penang politics, has few enemies and came in No. 1 in the last state DAP election, befitting chief minister status.\n\nIn second place was Sungai Puyu assemblyman Phee Boon Poh, a powerful warlord whose wealthy family has business roots in Seberang Perai.\n\nThere have been rumours of rivalry between Chow and Phee, but the two teamed up for the state election and it was a perfect instance of two being better than one.\n\nPhee's network in Penang stretches back to the years when DAP had only one assemblyman in the state, namely him.\n\nChow will need the support of the old guard like Phee in the coming months to organise and mobilise the ground.\n\nThe Chief Minister has produced a beautiful report card, he enjoys public approval and support from warlords.\n\nNow he has to cross the toughest hurdle of all \u2013 securing a credible mandate in the general election.",

Since Parit 5 was completed in 2018, we have been able to control the situation but this time, it was beyond capacity,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe will take note of the people\u2019s pleas and look into better solutions,\u201d added Chow.\n\nChow said the state government is always monitoring flood-prone areas and has been actively carrying out flood mitigation projects.\n\n\u201cWe spent RM300mil in the past 10 years for flood mitigation projects. However, if it is beyond its capacity, flooding will still happen,\u201d he said.\n\nDID assistant engineer Rozali Saad flood said they started monitoring the situation when the rain started until early morning on Saturday (Nov 12).\n\n\u201cWe will carry out an investigation and identify the exact cause.

        "GEORGE TOWN: The Tanjong parliamentary seat, now vacated by Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow after his move to Batu Kawan, has a colourful history with some of Malaysia\u2019s epic electoral battles taking place.\n\nFor now, the chase for the 13 parliamentary seats in Penang is going smoothly, both via physical ceramah and on social media, with big guns from Pakatan Harapan, Barisan Nasional and Perikatan Nasional coming out with guns blazing.But the Tanjong seat will be among those that are closely watched.\n\nIt brings to mind the fiery battle between DAP stalwart Lim Kit Siang and Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon in 1986.\n\nThat was when Kit Siang \u201cparachuted\u201d into the seat to try and wrest the seat away from Koh in what was dubbed the \u201cBattle for Tanjong\u201d.\n\nKit Siang won the keenly-contested match and managed to retain the seat again four years later, which was dubbed Tanjong 2.\n\nThis time around, DAP won 14 state seats to deny Barisan a two-thirds majority in the state assembly.Kit Siang also captured the Padang Kota state seat at the expense of then chief minister Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu.\n\nBuoyed by the splendid performance, Kit Siang went into battle full of confidence and vigour for the \u201cTanjong Three\u201d fight in the Tanjong Bungah state seat in 1995.\n\nHe portrayed himself as the \u201cRobocop\u201d who would save all Penangites and lead Penang to greater heights. Posters showing Kit Siang in a Robocop outfit were plastered all over the island.\n\nBut the party\u2019s strategy backfired spectacularly. DAP was dealt a crushing blow when not only Kit Siang was toppled by Koh, but the party only managed to win one state seat in Batu Lancang in that election.\n\nFast forward to today, the battle for Tanjong is shaping up to be a real thriller with two women candidates in Tan Kim Nee (MCA) and Kit Siang\u2019s daughter Hui Ying (DAP) in the fray.\n\nTan, 38, has been with the MCA for the past 17 years while Lim, 59, is a one-term senator.\n\nAlthough both Tan and Hui Ying will be contesting in GE15 for the first time, the latter has more pedigree as she comes from a famous family in the Malaysian political scene. Her older brother is Guan Eng, the former finance minister and former Penang chief minister.\n\nGerakan\u2019s (Perikatan Nasional) H\u2019ng Khoon Leng, 58, is the dark horse in the fight.\n\nOne thing is for sure, it won\u2019t be a shoo-in for anyone.\n\n\u201cPenang lang (Penangites) are quite rebellious and unpredictable. You can\u2019t predict which way they are going to vote,\u201d said Chiew, a trader at the Esplanade.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are also quite loyal. We don\u2019t easily forget a good leader.\u201d\n\nAnother Tanjong voter, KK Loh, said nothing could be taken for granted in GE15.\n\n\u201cAlthough this constituency has been a DAP stronghold, voters may want a change after so many years. I\u2019m keeping my options open,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of Sept 15, the Tanjong parliamentary seat has 52,859 voters with the majority being Chinese at 43,019 voters, followed by Indians (5,990), Malays (5,451) and others (399).",

        "How many tour operators derive their core business from ecotourism? The answer is, less than 2% of the 4,794 travel and tour companies currently registered with the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry.\n\nIf so, should the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, or Tourism Malaysia for short, continue to promote ecotourism overseas? The answer is a resounding yes!\n\nThis is because ecotourism is closely associated with the natural environment and hospitable weather. A good indicator is the amount of land still under tropical forest cover.\n\nAt a forum on forests at the United Nations Headquarters in May this year, Malaysia reported that 55.31% or 18.27 million hectares of its total land area is under forest cover.\n\nAt times, we may complain about our hot and humid weather. But these pale in comparison with the biting cold in winter of some countries where one could die of hypothermia when immersed in icy cold water.\n\nThankfully, the waters around our shores are relatively warm throughout the year and foreign visitors have no qualms plunging into the sea for swimming or diving or indulging in beach activities.\n\nExcept for more rain during certain periods of the year with some gusts of strong wind, and occasional mild tremors, we are free of devastating typhoons, earthquakes and volcanoes.\n\nAs such, our kind weather, sandy beaches and tropical rainforests have drawn an average of 26 million foreigners a year from 2012 to 2019, and they thoroughly enjoyed our hospitality, facilities and amenities.\n\nIn 2019, the main activities of foreign tourists were shopping (91.2%), sightseeing in cities (90.9%), visiting historical sites (31.9%), museums (27.8%), islands and beaches (26.9%), theme parks (24.9%), entertainment and night life (23.4%) and swimming (22%).\n\nAs for islands, visitors could easily go by themselves, while some were brought there by tour operators. As for beaches, they are usually within walking distance and most guests prefer to swim safely in the hotel pool than the open sea, as swimmers could easily be swept far away from shore by rip currents.\n\nThe main activity for which leisure tourists need the service of tour operators is visiting the many national parks, and may include exploration of caves, where visitors may not just enter and exit as they like.\n\nOverall, the number of tourists that made use of tour operators for ecotourism services is less than 1% of the 26 million foreign tourists per year that came before the pandemic.\n\nIn fact, it was way below 260,000 even with the addition of domestic tourists, although there were 239.1 million domestic visitors making 332.4 million trips and spending RM103.2bil in 2019.\n\nThis is because the main purposes of domestic visitors were visiting relatives and friends (42.3%), shopping (35.4%), holiday, leisure and relaxation (9%), entertainment, attending special event and sports (4%) and medical treatment and wellness (4%).\n\nAnd their main expenditure components were shopping (37.8%), automotive fuel (15%), food and beverage (14.3%), visiting households (10.2%), accommodation (8.4%), transportation (6.2%), other activities (5%) and before the trip, package, entrance fees and tickets (3.1%).\n\nAlthough the numbers of domestic visitors and expenditures were huge, tour operators had little to gain from domestic tourism as the majority drove their own vehicles or used public transport, with RM15.48bil spent on automotive fuel alone in 2019.\n\nMore than 68% of domestic tourists lodged with relatives and friends. Those that stayed in hotels, apartments, homestays, chalets and rest houses mostly booked these paid accommodations directly, without the need to go through travel agencies.\n\nAs for visiting natural sites such as popular beaches, streams or waterfalls, these are not touristic but leisure activities, although such trips are counted in domestic tourism surveys by the Department of Statistics.\n\nMistakenly, local authorities and state governments have been using the term \"tourism\" too freely. Whenever new roads were built to reach remote mountain streams or waterfalls, they were touted as another tourism project.\n\nBut without facilities for overnight accommodation, all visitors are just excursionists and not tourists. And without a concessionaire to maintain cleanliness, the vicinity would soon be strewn with rubbish left behind by picnickers and mobile hawkers.\n\nIt would be disgraceful to tout ecotourism after many pristine sites in our jungles have been turned into garbage dumps infested with flies and rodents.\n\nWorse, visitors could be exposed to rat urine which causes leptospirosis that can lead to kidney damage, inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.\n\nWhen launching the Natural Resources Ecotourism Empowerment Programme in Kota Baru recently, Energy and National Resources Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan said the government aims to brand Malaysia as a \"Top of The Mind Ecotourism Destination of the World\".\n\nEcotourism has been bandied about for umpteenth time by many, but what exactly is ecotourism?\n\nAccording to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, ecotourism encompasses all nature-based forms of tourism in which the main motivation of the tourists is the observation and appreciation of nature as well as the traditional cultures prevailing in natural areas.\n\nAnd the International Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as responsible travel to natural areas that conserve the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education.\n\nBoth organisations mentioned traditional cultures and local people. In 2019, there were 210,611 aborigines known as Orang Asli in peninsular Malaysia.\n\nWill tourists get to see these natives' way of life, practised in harmony with their natural environment over the centuries? Or will visitors be witnessing indigenous people being displaced from their ancestral lands by greedy loggers and corrupt officials?\n\nI have a simple definition of ecotourism. As eco means nature-friendly or not harming the environment, ecotourism could simply be defined as nature-friendly tourism.\n\nIf so, all natural sites that are now being degraded or desecrated should not be promoted as ecotourism until harmful activities are stopped or reduced drastically.\n\nIn recent years, deforestation from logging resulted in massive flooding as rainwater was not absorbed by jungles, and huge quantities of debris from trees, shrubs and wood waste were swept downstream.\n\nRecently, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said his ministry had identified as many as 5,500 flood hotspots across the country.\n\nThe following day, Takiyuddin Hassan announced that a total of 186 forested and recreational areas at risk of suffering a water surge would be closed from November to January next year.\n\nIn any case, the majority of tour operators have little to gain or lose from ecotourism, as almost all visitors engaged in leisure or recreational activities at natural sites could make travel arrangements themselves.\n\nYS CHAN, Kuala Lumpur\n\n(YS Chan is the master trainer for Mesra Malaysia and Travel and Tours Enhancement Course and an Asean Tourism Master Trainer.

        "TAIPING: After witnessing how bad governance brought Venezuela to its knees in his first foreign assignment at the Malaysian embassy in Caracas, Taiping-born Neow Choo Seong is determined to make sure that Malaysia does not go down the same path.\n\nThe diplomat-turned-politician points out startling similarities between the two countries \u2013 namely the dependence on rich natural resources such as oil, as well as the strong focus on welfare.\n\nBut it\u2019s high time for Malaysia to move beyond welfare and hand-outs, he tells The Star, noting that the goal should be to ensure economic sustainability.\n\nFresh from a four-year stint with first-hand experience of the Capitol riots and the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, he is ready to take on the challenge of transforming Malaysia\u2019s political landscape to strengthen its economy and prosperity \u2013 starting with Taiping.\n\nThe turning point for Neow was his experience with FoodBank Taiping, when he helped to give out food and hampers to poor families, following his return to the country in late December last year.\n\n\u201cSeeing that so many people were really in need of attention, it devastated me and reminded me of what happened in Venezuela. I realised that giving out one-off aid like that won\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d he shares.\n\nNeow, 37, is contesting in the Taiping parliamentary constituency at the 15th General Election on Nov 19. It will be his first time contesting in a general election, a similarity he shares with many other candidates in MCA\u2019s team of fresh-faced youths under the Barisan Nasional banner in GE15.\n\nNeow may be new to politics, but he has already served Malaysia and its people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 13 years, in the field of international relations \u2013 an interest that traces back to his secondary school days.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, people usually associate Barisan with issues of corruption and bad governance.\n\n\u201cBut I want to prove to the world, not only Malaysians, that the past is past and there are young politicians who are coming up and are fighting for change.\n\n\u201cWe need more young blood in politics. We need people with fresh vision, integrity, charisma and sincerity. That\u2019s why I signed up. As a civil servant myself, I can see how these issues hinder development of the country. Without stability and good governance, investors won\u2019t come in,\u201d he says.\n\nWith a population exceeding 120,000 of which more than 90,000 are voters, Taiping\u2019s economy is no longer as vibrant as before, a situation that has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNow a Perak FC board member, the former state football player wants to inject new life into Taiping while preserving its historical elements, as Taiping has regressed into a retirement town from its heyday as a popular destination with local and international tourists.\n\nFirmly believing that diplomacy is the bedrock of success, Neow has set \u201cvery pragmatic benchmarks\u201d in the form of five agendas for his vision to transform Taiping \u2013 economy, education, healthcare, security and safety, and infrastructure.\n\nIn his two-pronged approach to rejuvenate Taiping\u2019s economy, Neow will have to strike the right balance between proper planning and development of industrialisation and eco-tourism, in order to preserve the heritage town and the flora and fauna in its ecosystem.\n\nHe candidly admits that his selling point is the arsenal of experience, network and connections built during his diplomatic career, which he wants to leverage in hopes of increasing American and Chinese foreign direct investment into Kamunting Industrial Park and other underutilised parcels of land \u2013 ultimately generating new job opportunities in and attracting new blood to Taiping.\n\nIn the short-term, however, tourism could be the answer. An influx of tourists would positively impact local businesses and enable them to thrive, especially as around 41% of businesses in Perak are involved in services, followed by 29% in wholesale and retail.\n\nConsidering that more than 90% of the nation\u2019s business establishments are rooted in micro, small and medium enterprises such as hawkers and retailers, it gives a fair indication that efforts along these lines could pay off.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the younger generation of business owners are not doing what they can. But it\u2019s not enough. What\u2019s needed is a systematic, concerted effort from the government to promote Taiping.\n\nAs online news portal Twentytwo13 reported in 2019, young business owners have been calling for local authorities to join hands with the private sector to draw more tourists.\n\nThe complaint: Lack of readily available information on Taiping, despite its rich history and the poorly maintained main attractions, such as Maxwell Hill and Taiping Zoo.\n\nSharing this sentiment, Neow wants to transform Barrack Road into a heritage street the likes of Melaka\u2019s Jonker Street, to put the spotlight on the town\u2019s rich history.\n\nIn addition, he is looking to revamp poorly managed tourist attractions and promote Taiping as an eco-tourism destination.\n\nMoreover, in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the establishment of Taiping and the 50th anniversary of Malaysia-China bilateral relations in 2024, he wants to bring \u201cpanda diplomacy\u201d via a pair of pandas to the town.\n\nNeow Choo Seong (MCA/Barisan Nasional) faces Wong Kah Woh (DAP/Pakatan Harapan), See Tean Seng (Gerakan/Perikatan Nasional) and independent candidates Mohganan P.

So there is a decrease in terms of percentage.\n\n\"A total of RM12.612bil (20.2%) is used for the purpose of covering PFI (private finance initiative) liability and guarantee commitment.\n\n\"Another RM8.711bil (14%) is used for the purpose of classification of operating expenditure for development,\" said Wong.\n\nAt the same press conference, Nik Azman said the borrowing of money to service debts should only be a short-term measure.\n\n\"It is understood that loans are usually made to finance development expenses.\n\n\"But because of the Covid-19 pandemic, about half of the loans are used for pandemic-control activities as well as economic generation to help affected companies. This, we can understand.\n\n\"But what we are worried about is that this high increase of debt cannot continue.\n\n\"It should only be a short-term temporary measure. The government must take corrective action so that the debt situation is manageable and can be controlled,\" said Nik Azman.\n\nHe pointed out that because of the increase in national debt, the interest payment had also gone up - with 16.3% of revenue collected used for that purpose.\n\n\"That means, for RM1 revenue collected, 16 sen is used to pay interest. So this needs to be only a temporary measure and as auditors, it is our duty to remind the government on this,\" said Nik Azman.",

They know that without him, Anwar would not be where he is.\n\nIt has not been easy for Anwar to accommodate the demands of his new partners.\n\nBarisan felt it deserved portfolios that befit its role as kingmaker while GPS had its own Sarawak-centric priorities.\n\nAnwar promised a lean Cabinet but the end result was anything but lean.\n\nThere are a total of 25 ministers with another three portfolios held by the Prime Minister and the two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nIt is only slightly less crowded than the previous 33-person Cabinet.\n\nThe most interesting part of Anwar\u2019s Cabinet was in the economic appointments.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose top priority is economic recovery, is also Finance Minister.\n\nFormer Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Hassan Marican has been roped in as an economic adviser because the reputed technocrat can help inject investor confidence.\n\nPandan MP Rafizi Ramli, whose supporters wanted him for the finance post, is Economy Minister.\n\nThe odd man out in the economic box is International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz who was certainly not in Anwar\u2019s shortlist of candidates.\n\nThis is the second time that Tengku Zafrul, who lost in Kuala Selangor in the recent elections, is making a back door entry into the Cabinet.\n\nIt is a rather mixed bag of personalities that has been entrusted to revive the economy.\n\nThe same could be said for the general line-up, too.\n\n\u201cIt is a line-up of younger and fresher faces especially those from PKR.

Was it to puncture accusations that DAP dominates the government?\n\nDAP\u2019s portfolios \u2013 Transport, Local Government, Youth and Sports and Human Resources \u2013 are important and will enable the party to reach out to its base.\n\nIts Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo was said to have declined a seat in the Cabinet.\n\nAnwar\u2019s other concern is to ensure that his government survives a full term and that means keeping his partners contented so they do not get up to any mischief.\n\nBoth Barisan and GPS got almost equal treatment although Ahmad Zahid was obviously the big winner, landing the Rural Development portfolio.

Others say it is for the sake of stability.\n\nActually, it is Machiavellian politics at its best where the end justifies the means.\n\nBut nobody wants to see more political instability and that is why Anwar should get a chance to do his job for the next five years.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",

The town planning needs to be better, and I will leverage on my technical background to assist on this,\u201d says Chong who holds a degree in civil engineering.\n\nCheras has transformed into an ultra-urban township \u2013 from its early days in the 1900s as a flourishing hub for rubber plantations and tin mines.\n\nToday, it is a densely populated area due to its close proximity to the Kuala Lumpur city centre, as well as connectivity via major highways such as the East-West Link Expressway, Middle Ring Road 2, Kajang SILK Highway, Cheras-Kajang Expressway, and the upcoming East Klang Valley Expressway.\n\n\u201cDemand for properties in Cheras will continue to rise, and this will push prices up.\n\n\u201cHowever, the reality is that not everyone can afford properties at market value.

        "LIVERPOOL (Reuters) -Liverpool put their recent stutters behind them to comfortably beat Rangers 2-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday and move into second spot in Group A.\n\nThe win, thanks to a sumptuous first-half free kick from Trent Alexander-Arnold and a second-half penalty by Mohamed Salah, put the six-times European champions on six points after three games - three points behind leaders Napoli.\n\nThe Scots, who barely threatened Liverpool to the disappointment of their passionate fans complete with a bagpipe-player, remain bottom of the group on zero points.\n\nIn need of a morale booster after their poor start to the Premier League, Liverpool's four-man attack of Salah, Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez swarmed over Rangers from the off. By contrast, the visitors' Colombian striker Alfredo Morelos was largely isolated.\n\nLiverpool manager Juergen Klopp was delighted by his team's tidy and confident performance, albeit against obviously weaker opposition, especially the first goal from Alexander-Arnold whom he had defended from recent criticism.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, whose chances of making England's World Cup squad are in the balance after recent below-par displays, struck a superb free kick over the wall and past Rangers keeper Allan McGregor in the seventh minute to raise the roof off Anfield.\n\n\"All that matters is performing for the team. It's been a slow start to the season but I'm looking forward to the rest of the season,\" said Alexander-Arnold, who drew a standing ovation when he was substituted late in the game.\n\n\"The performance was great from the lads. On Saturday, it was disappointing. It was the complete opposite today,\" he added, referring to Liverpool's 3-3 home draw with Brighton at the weekend.\n\nGULF IN LEAGUES\n\nLiverpool's Nunez could have had a hat-trick in the first half as McGregor pulled off four saves in succession from the Uruguayan striker.\n\nBut it was Salah who scored the second from the penalty spot in the 53rd minute after Diaz was brought down in the box.\n\nThe so-called \"Battle of Britain\" clash underlined the gulf in quality between the top flight divisions in England and Scotland.\n\nRangers looked drained and exhausted trying to stem Liverpool's attacks as the intuitive Thiago Alcantara blocked attacks and fed through balls from midfield.\n\nVirgil van Dijk, who has been in the firing line for Liverpool's leaky defence of late, was barely troubled at the back, although Rangers substitute Rabbi Matondo did force a goal line clearance from Kostas Tsimikas in the dying minutes.\n\n\"We are competing against one of the best sides in Europe. The level we face is very high and the level we have today wasn't good enough to get something out of the game,\" said Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst.\n\nThe former Netherlands midfielder praised his side, however, for limiting Liverpool to two goals and for an improved second-half performance. \"We will learn from this game,\" he said, singling out goalkeeper McGregor for a strong performance.\n\nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson said the win was a relief after recent pressure on the team, who sit an uncharacteristic ninth in the Premier League and lost their opening Group A clash to Napoli.\n\n\"It felt good out there,\" he said.\n\n\"You try to not listen to social media, especially when you're going through a tough period as a team. But it can be difficult, it can hurt. You have to try and find a way to use that as fuel when you get out on the pitch.\"\n\n(Reporting by Andrew CawthorneEditing by Toby Davis)",
        "(Reuters) - Barcelona midfielder Pedri will turn 20 years old two days before Spain face Germany in one of the most anticipated games of the World Cup group stage.\n\nThe midfielder could be highly influential against the four-time world champions as both nations are expected to finish in the top two of Group E, the so called the group of death, with Japan and Costa Rica as the underdogs.\n\nPedri was a key part of Spain's run to the semi-finals of the European Championship last year and, along with his performances for his club, won both the 2021 Golden Boy and Kopa Trophy, awarded to the best player under the age of 21.\n\n\"Pedri is a unique player. I have never seen anything like it, not even (Andres) Iniesta at the same age,\" Spain manager Luis Enrique said after the Euro 2020 semi-final against eventual champions Italy, having lost in a penalty shootout.\n\n\"Have you seen the Euro that Pedri has done? I have not seen any 18-year-old player in any competition do the same.\n\n\"How he has performed, how he occupies the spaces, his personality... I have never seen anything like it. It is something out of all logic.\"\n\nLuis Enrique has been enamoured with Pedri's pace, positional intelligence and supreme technical ability, a classic trademark of the famed Barcelona La Masia academy where players like Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez and Lionel Messi were moulded.\n\nHowever, Pedri's time in Barcelona has been relatively short. Born in Tegueste, a small town in Tenerife, in November 2002, Pedri moved from Las Palmas to Barca a little more than two years ago, in July 2020, for five million euros ($4.92 million).\n\nBefore having his breakout season in his first year with Barca in 2020-21, he had already become the youngest player to score for Las Palmas in the Spanish second division at 16-years-old.\n\nHis first season at Barcelona was so outstanding that Pedri played 73 games in all competitions for his club and Spain. Only a few weeks after the Euros, Pedri went to Japan and helped his country to win the Olympic silver medal, losing the final 2-1 in extra time against Brazil.\n\n($1 = 1.0165 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Fernando Kallas; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",

        "KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit opened lower against the US dollar for the fifth consecutive day today as investors paid close attention to the US Federal Reserve (Fed) decision later today, dealers said.\n\nAt 9 am, the local currency fell to 4.7420/7450 against the greenback from Tuesday's close of 4.7345/7375.\n\nActivTrades trader Dyogenes Rodrigues Diniz said the US dollar was once again rising against the ringgit ahead of the US interest rate decision on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 per cent. If that hike materialises, it will be the fourth consecutive increase of that size. A rise in line with expectations would likely see the dollar fall at first, as the market has already widely priced in this increase.\n\n\"But investors will pay close attention to the Fed's statements at the press conference following the announcement of the decision, which should set the tone for future monetary policy steps,\" he said.\n\nDiniz said some experts were already forecasting a slowdown in the pace of hikes from as early as December, which might mean the Fed would raise interest rates by just 0.5 per cent at the next meeting.\n\nHe added that investors should also pay attention to the Malaysian interest rate decision to be released on Thursday.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia is projected to raise the Overnight Policy Rate from 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent, a much smaller increase than the one expected in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies, except the Japanese yen.\n\nThe local note appreciated against the euro to 4.6879/6909 from 4.7033/7062 at Tuesday\u2019s close, improved vis-a-vis the Singapore dollar to 3.3536/3562 from 3.3571/3595, and went up versus the British pound to 5.4547/4582 from 5.4608/4642.\n\nHowever, it dropped against the Japanese yen at 3.2202/2224 from 3.2107/2130 yesterday. - Bernama",
        "KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit continued to slide against the US dollar, breaching the all-time low that was recorded during the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) period in 1998.\n\nThis was due to the continuous local and global economic headwinds, analysts said.\n\nAs at 6pm, the ringgit was traded at 4.7270/7290, which was lower than the 4.7250 level recorded on Jan 7, 1998. At Wednesday\u2019s closing, the local note was traded at 4.7180/7220.\n\nSPI Asset Management managing director Stephen Innes said the ringgit extended its downward momentum as the US bond yields soared on the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) hawkish sentiment.\n\nHe also said despite the headline that Chinese officials are debating cutting inbound COVID-19 quarantine, there has been little respite for the beleaguered ringgit versus the US dollar.\n\n\"Markets are also cautious about China President Xi Jinping\u2019s common-prosperity drive as the 20th CPC Congress raised a new term \"to regulate the mechanism of wealth accumulation\".\n\n\"But right now, the hawkish Fed is the biggest game in town for foreign exchange (FX) markets, and provided the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a change of heart, then things could change for the better for the ringgit,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nBesides, Innes said, it is not only the ringgit that has weakened. The Japanese yen, one of the strongest currency in the world, breached the 150 line and hit a 32-year low against the US dollar on Thursday.\n\nHe said the weaker yen has been a bit of a bellwether for Asia FX, stemming from a competitive trade advantage in the sense where Japan and China are huge competitors in the export market, and a weaker currency is perceived as more advantageous for stimulating external trade.\n\n\"The weaker yen is now also creating a massive trade deficit. August's Japan trade deficit of 2.8 trillion yen was the widest going back to 1993.\n\n\"The continued yen weakness is the biggest headwind to Japan's trade balance, with trade data showing the yen to be 27 per cent weaker than it was a year earlier.\n\n\"The persistent trade deficit may dampen Japan's economic recovery as rising import costs could slow domestic consumption. I think we are nearing the end of the road for the yen weakness as the Bank of Japan may need to pull away from its ultra-dovish policy,\u201d Innes added.\n\nMeanwhile, the ringgit was higher against a basket of major currencies.\n\nIt improved versus the Japanese yen to 3.1547/1565 from 3.1611/1642 on Wednesday\u2019s closing and edged up against the Singapore dollar to 3.3172/3188 from 3.3176/3207 previously.\n\nThe local currency also rose against the euro to 4.6244/6264 from 4.6326/6365 on Wednesday and gained vis-a-vis the British pound to 5.2971/29935 from 5.3233/3278 at the close yesterday. - Bernama",

The 25-year-old scored only five goals in 32 matches last season.\n\n\"It's a complete different energy around the club and the training ground,\" Rashford told Sky Sports. \"That puts me in a better headspace and I feel really motivated now.\n\n\"I was struggling at times with more mental things. It wasn't really my own performance but other things off the pitch. That's the biggest difference from last season.\n\n\"I get that it's your job to speak about what happens on the pitch but for players, we have to get into the right headspace for every game.

But disappointingly, many politicians have not been wearing face masks when meeting the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur advice is to wear face masks when attending any political event.

As for physical ceramah, he said it has to be held at open areas such as a field and seats should also be spread out.\n\nPublic health advocate and Volunteers For Community Engagement and Empowerment for Covid-19 chairman Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said the number of cases could trend in the 4,000-5,000 range in the next two to three weeks due to the numerous gatherings across the country.\n\nHe advised those on the ground to continue taking precautionary measures, get booster shots and avoid public events if they are unwell.",
        "ECOTOURISM activities have been both a boon and a bane for Gopeng residents.\n\nThe town that is some 20km from the Perak state capital of Ipoh, is popular for some of its natural attractions such as Gua Tempurung and outdoor activities like whitewater rafting and camping.\n\nHowever, the number of weekend visitors has worsened traffic congestion, especially along Jalan Ipoh-Kampar between Simpang Pulai and Gopeng town.\n\nThis was identified as one of the primary issues faced by Gopeng folks.\n\nAccording to residents who spoke to StarMetro, the congestion gets especially bad during weekends and long holidays as the narrow roads will be jammed with cars.\n\nTrader Lok Pei Yee, 42, hopes that the issue can be addressed by the new MP, as the congestion starts as early as 7am.\n\n\u201cDuring weekdays, Gopeng will usually be quiet and it is easier for locals like me to go around town. We also have customers staying in Simpang Pulai coming over to enjoy our local food.\n\n\u201cBut during weekends, the (8km) drive from Gopeng to Simpang Pulai takes hours due to the congested roads. It is so hard to even get onto the main roads because there are many cars as early as 7am,\u201d she said.\n\nGua Kandu Gopeng is one of Gopeng\u2019s many ecotourism spots that attracts a steady stream of visitors. \u2014 Filepic\n\n\u201cOf course, I am happy with the high number of tourists coming into town. While it does help my business, I wish the authorities could widen the roads or perhaps provide an alternative route for us to go nearby towns on weekends,\u201d she said, attributing the congestion to the influx of ecotourism visitors.\u201cMost of the tourists come here for whitewater rafting, camping, and other recreational activities. They also come here for the food.\n\n\u201cI hope the new Gopeng MP will speak up about the congested roads here,\u201d Lok added.\n\nThe Gopeng parliamentary seat will have a new MP after Dr Lee Boon Chye of PKR, decided not to defend the seat.\n\nPakatan Harapan and PKR will be represented by Tan Kar Hing, who will be contesting against Barisan Nasional\u2019s Cally Ting Zhao Song, Bersatu\u2019s Muhammad Farhan Abdul Rahim and Dr Balachandran Gopal from Warisan.\n\nDuring the 14th General Election, Dr Lee won with a majority of 29,778 votes against Barisan-MCA\u2019s Datuk Heng Seai Kie and Ismail Ariffin of PAS.\n\nGopeng parliamentary constituency has over 140,000 registered voters and consists of three state seats namely Teja, Simpang Pulai, and Sungai Rapat.\n\nWhitewater rafting is among the popular outdoor activities in Gopeng that attracts many tourists. \u2014 Filepic\n\nFirst-time voter A. Remoshini said she hoped that the new MP would push to create more job opportunities in Gopeng.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, it took me months to find a job in Gopeng. My friends and I went from shop to shop to see if there were any vacancies. We were asked to fill in the forms, but none of them called us back.\n\n\u201cI decided to go to Johor Baru, and within a month, I managed to secure a job as a cashier.\n\n\u201cAs I had just finished school, I wasn\u2019t looking for a white-collar job, but even then there were no job vacancies in Gopeng,\u201d said the 21-year-old student.\n\nRemoshini said there was also a need for more government department offices to be set up in Gopeng.\n\n\u201cRight now we have to go either to Kampar or Ipoh just to get things done. The public transportation system used to be quite good before the movement control order but it is not so reliable now.\n\n\u201cBack then, buses would come every 20 to 30 minutes. Now, it takes more than an hour for a bus to arrive and when it does, it is crowded,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I are forced to stand in the bus for hours, as the traffic congestion is especially bad during rush hour and on weekends.\n\n\u201cI am quite lucky that my father has a car so he can drive me to Ipoh sometimes, but what about those who don\u2019t have their own transport?\n\n\u201cSince I am a first-time voter, I am excited. My friends and I will look into all the candidates contesting for the Gopeng parliamentary seat and make an informed decision,\u201d said Remoshini.\n\n\u201cWe want an MP who can address our problems and solve them. We need more job opportunities and a better transportation service in Gopeng,\u201d she added.\n\nMany in Gopeng rely on public transportation and they complain that the buses are not regular.\n\nRestaurant owner Miszuan Ramli, 44, hopes the new MP will speak up about the price hike of essential items.\n\n\u201cFrom time to time, we will have customers complaining about the prices of our food and drinks.\n\n\u201cThey question why a small town like Gopeng charges nearly the same price as the big cities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to explain to them about the price hike for items such as curry powder and condensed milk.\n\n\u201cFor example, we use 2.5kg of curry powder a month. It used to cost us about RM4.30 per 250g pack, but now it has gone up to RM5,\u201d he said, adding that most items now cost 30% more.\n\nMiszuan said that whoever was elected MP should be always available at their service centre to listen to the residents\u2019 problems and not just drop by occasionally.\n\nOn the traffic issue, Barisan candidate Ting said it had been a longstanding problem and a master plan was needed to resolve it.\n\n\u201cThe obvious idea is of course to widen the roads, but I think we need to have a wider perspective.\u201cThere needs to be a balance and proper planning so that it will not be a waste of money in the future.\n\n\u201cI can get the experts\u2019 opinions on how to make things right,\u201d she said.\n\nTing also wants to create more job opportunities so that youths will remain in Gopeng.\n\n\u201cIt will be a big task but nothing is impossible. There needs to be a starting point and we need to lay the foundations first.\n\n\u201cI feel that the industrial sector is one area that we can look at, by bringing in more high-tech or even robotics industries.\n\n\u201cGraduates no longer just want to be technicians.

        "SHAH ALAM: Those expecting a showdown of sorts between PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his deputy Rafizi Ramli during their party national congress have been left disappointed.\n\nDuring his winding-up speech, Rafizi, who is known for his sharp tongue, pledged his loyalty to Anwar and assured him that he would not betray him.\n\nAddressing Anwar directly, Rafizi said he might be loud but he was \u201cnot Datuk Seri Azmin Ali\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr President, I do not make sweet promises and then stab you in the back.\n\n\u201cI have never promised to break down the prison wall to free Anwar,\u201d said Rafizi.\n\nHe maintained that he was not the sort who would make a promise in front of a person and then negotiate for positions behind his back.\n\nIt is believed that Rafizi was referring to a speech by Azmin about a decade ago in which he said that he was prepared to break the prison walls to get Anwar if the party president was imprisoned.\n\nAzmin, who was former party deputy president had led the defection of a substantial number of elected representatives from the party in 2020 which nearly crippled PKR and caused the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan government.\n\nOn Saturday, Rafizi told reporters that PKR members should not resort to \u201capple polishing\u201d Anwar.\n\nPrior to that, he had claimed that research carried out by his think-tank revealed that Anwar\u2019s popularity was waning.\n\nSuch blunt remarks had led to expectations of fireworks at the final day of PKR\u2019s national congress yesterday.\n\nHowever, Rafizi said in his speech he wanted to be judged on his effort, hard work and service to the party even though he did not praise Anwar.\n\nHe also said that he would continue to be sharp-tongued and critical as he did not know how to sweet talk.\n\nEarlier, Rafizi said PKR had worked hard to deliver to the people what they required and deserved.\n\n\u201cThe people know this and they are thankful to us for it.\n\n\u201cBut we have to remember and respect that once we become the government, their expectations of us will become more complicated,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said the people wanted to see how the new government could resolve their problems, adding that this could not be done by delivering mere speeches and ideas.\n\nThe onus was on the new government to use its ability, skills and intellect to prove that it was better than its predecessor, he added.\n\nIt also appears that Rafizi is all set for his task with the help of his loyalists who make up a majority of the elected members in the central leadership council.\n\nThirteen out of the 20 elected central leadership council members for the 2022-2025 term were from a list of 25 names tweeted by Rafizi earlier last week.\n\nAmong them are Johor Baru MP Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, Bakar Arang assemblyman Ooi Tze Min, Simpang Pulai assemblyman Tan Kar Hing, Subang MP Wong Chen, Merbok MP Nor Azrina Surip, Semambu assemblyman Lee Chean Chung and celebrity Datuk Hans Issac.",

After that, he disappears.\n\n\"This mystical individual, Rafizi, never made an appearance when we were suffering during Covid-19,\" added the Tapah MP.\n\nLast month, Rafizi launched an online petition against holding GE15 during the year-end period, when floods occur.\n\nSaravanan was then asked by several Opposition MPs to answer the question instead of bringing up Rafizi's name.\n\nDeputy Speaker Datuk Ramli Mohd Nor interjected and asked the minister not to digress from the topic at hand, which was the Bill.\n\nSaravanan cited weather forecasts that floods would only strike after mid-November and there would be no issue if Parliament is dissolved and GE15 held before the end of the month.\n\nLim Guan Eng (PH-Bagan) then said Rafizi should not be blamed as it was the position of the whole Opposition.\n\n\"Every time during monsoon season there are floods... We can't (expect people) to ride a sampan to vote,\" said Lim.\n\nIn response, Saravanan said: \"YB Bagan, no one has said that they want GE15 to be held during the floods and so far, no one has said when it will be held or if it will be during the floods or not.\"\n\n\"Secondly, the administration under the Prime Minister's leadership already planned nine months in advance how we can overcome floods by using previous years' experiences,\" he said, adding that preparations for this year had begun early.\n\n\"Finally, even if we dissolve Parliament and call for a general election during the floods, why should the Opposition worry as the people will support you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Let us make mistakes.

        "A controversial appointment almost eclipses Anwar\u2019s maiden Cabinet but it is generally a line-up of younger and fresher faces.\n\nTHE most asked question in the last one week has finally been answered.\n\nAnd the answer is: Yes, Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is once again Deputy Prime Minister alongside Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).\n\nThe man responsible for Barisan Nasional throwing its support behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has made a grand but controversial return to the office he occupied from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIt is the mother of all ironies that Ahmad Zahid has gone from zero to hero among Pakatan Harapan supporters. They know that without him, Anwar would not be where he is.\n\nIt has not been easy for Anwar to accommodate the demands of his new partners.\n\nBarisan felt it deserved portfolios that befit its role as kingmaker while GPS had its own Sarawak-centric priorities.\n\nAnwar promised a lean Cabinet but the end result was anything but lean.\n\nThere are a total of 25 ministers with another three portfolios held by the Prime Minister and the two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nIt is only slightly less crowded than the previous 33-person Cabinet.\n\nThe most interesting part of Anwar\u2019s Cabinet was in the economic appointments.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose top priority is economic recovery, is also Finance Minister.\n\nFormer Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Hassan Marican has been roped in as an economic adviser because the reputed technocrat can help inject investor confidence.\n\nPandan MP Rafizi Ramli, whose supporters wanted him for the finance post, is Economy Minister.\n\nThe odd man out in the economic box is International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz who was certainly not in Anwar\u2019s shortlist of candidates.\n\nThis is the second time that Tengku Zafrul, who lost in Kuala Selangor in the recent elections, is making a back door entry into the Cabinet.\n\nIt is a rather mixed bag of personalities that has been entrusted to revive the economy.\n\nThe same could be said for the general line-up, too.\n\n\u201cIt is a line-up of younger and fresher faces especially those from PKR. They will bring down the average age of the Cabinet, making it the youngest Cabinet we\u2019ve had in a long while,\u201d said political commentator Khaw Veon Szu.\n\nIt is also no coincidence that most of the ministers are Malays and Bumiputera.\n\nAnwar understands the power of optics, especially given that the opposition bench is almost entirely Malay and Muslim.\n\nA total of 15 portfolios went to Pakatan with PKR taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nSome think the political animal in Anwar is moving to strengthen his party.\n\nBut the fact is that PKR is a genuinely multiracial party, its leaders are well-educated, they do not harp on race and religion and they represent a Malaysia that many of us want to see.\n\nThose appointed are there on their own merit.\n\nWas it a strategic move for DAP to accept only four ministerships? Was it to puncture accusations that DAP dominates the government?\n\nDAP\u2019s portfolios \u2013 Transport, Local Government, Youth and Sports and Human Resources \u2013 are important and will enable the party to reach out to its base.\n\nIts Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo was said to have declined a seat in the Cabinet.\n\nAnwar\u2019s other concern is to ensure that his government survives a full term and that means keeping his partners contented so they do not get up to any mischief.\n\nBoth Barisan and GPS got almost equal treatment although Ahmad Zahid was obviously the big winner, landing the Rural Development portfolio. It is a coveted ministry because of its outreach to the Malay heartland.\n\nBut some things are not meant to be and Rembau MP Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who many thought would be the Deputy Prime Minister, ended up in Defence.\n\nAnwar has eased into the job quite smoothly, be it the outpouring of support and attention wherever he goes to audiences at the palace.\n\nAnyone else would have been overwhelmed by the sudden transition from Opposition leader to Prime Minister.\n\nHe has also set several admirable dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 open tenders for projects, no new official car, no unnecessary renovations to his office, no gifts and no salary for himself.\n\nThe air is still filled with euphoria over the rise of Anwar and it has been quite comical and sad too to watch Pakatan supporters fall over themselves trying to justify partnering with Umno and downplaying corruption issues.\n\nSome call it pragmatism. Others say it is for the sake of stability.\n\nActually, it is Machiavellian politics at its best where the end justifies the means.\n\nBut nobody wants to see more political instability and that is why Anwar should get a chance to do his job for the next five years.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",
        "PETALING JAYA: Despite objections to appointing individuals with ongoing court cases to the Cabinet, Chua Tian Chang, better known as Tian Chua, argues that Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi should be an exception, as the Umno president played a pivotal role in the present government.\n\nThe former PKR vice-president credited Ahmad Zahid for being firm in ensuring Barisan Nasional\u2019s support for Anwar\u2019s unity government, as there were many MPs in the Umno-led coalition who were initially hesitant about cooperating with Pakatan Harapan.\n\n\u201cAhmad Zahid played a pivotal role in pulling the grand coalition together. Not forgetting there was strong rejection within Barisan for cooperating with Pakatan in the initial stages.\n\n\u201cBarisan MPs were split over the choice of ruling partners. Ahmad Zahid\u2019s firm leadership swiftly ended the stalemate,\u201d said Chua in a statement Tuesday (Nov 29).\n\nChua said Pakatan has chosen to cooperate with Barisan and when in partnership, the two blocs must accord each other respect and accept parity.\n\n\u201cIf Barisan parties were to nominate their chairman into the Cabinet, it is not proper for Pakatan to pick and choose who they want.\n\n\u201cThis will be against the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAt the same time, Chua said that Pakatan and Barisan leaders have to build trust and confidence in each other if they wish to govern effectively.\n\n\u201cUndeniably, there\u2019s still scepticism within Barisan, especially Umno. Ahmad Zahid has demonstrated his ability to consolidate Barisan into a unified stance to cooperate with Pakatan,\u201d said Chua.\n\nChua also said Ahmad Zahid\u2019s experience in government was an advantage and he could complement the largely inexperienced Pakatan ministers.\n\n\u201cHe could also mediate between Pakatan and the civil service and more conservative segments of the government.\n\n\u201cHe could play a key role in stabilising the new government,\u201d said Chua.\n\n\u201cAhmad Zahid could also be useful in linking up other component parties in the grand coalition, such as Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), among others,\u201d added Chua.\n\nHe noted that there were arguments that Ahmad Zahid\u2019s inclusion in the Cabinet could jeopardise anti-graft efforts by the government.\n\nHowever, Chua said there was no immunity for any Cabinet member and Ahmad Zahid must still prove his innocence in court.\n\nMeanwhile, Chua also said barring leaders with ongoing court cases does not automatically bring about a cleaner government.\n\n\u201cThe previous government barred the 'court cluster' from Cabinet, yet it continued the practice of direct negotiations and favouritism in procurement, among others.\n\n\u201cThere were no effective reforms, yet it created a protracted tension between coalition parties,\u201d said Chua.\n\nTo fight corruption, Chua said there have to be genuine reforms to overhaul the present governing institutions systematically.\n\n\u201cUnless words can be translated into action, there is no point in moralising the leadership,\u201d added Chua.\n\nChua also said ensuring a corruption-free society wasn't merely about leaders upholding high moral standards.\n\n\u201cFor me, the most important work for the new government is to embark on actual reforms to build transparent and efficient delivery by government functionaries.\n\n\u201cThis requires courage from the new coalition leaders. Excluding the so-called 'court cluster' is a rather superficial public relations exercise,\u201d said Chua.\n\nChua also said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s move of not receiving a salary was mere \u201cself-projecting of a moral image\u201d.\n\nA non-salaried prime minister said Chua, does not translate to a clean government and it doesn\u2019t boost investor confidence.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, the government by right should study how to commensurate ministers to avoid bribery.\n\n\u201cIn short, to undertake comprehensive reforms, we need a strong and effective government.\n\n\u201cFortunately, Pakatan enjoyed a good start. But, it cannot afford a divergence with Barisan at this early stage,\u201d said Chua.\n\n\u201cCooperation between Anwar and Ahmad Zahid is absolutely crucial,\u201d added Chua.",

        "AFTER resigning from several positions in December 2018, PKR\u2019s Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar has reappeared in the media limelight by publicly playing down Pakatan Harapan\u2019s ambitions on retaking Putrajaya.\n\nThe media had a field day playing up her comment \u2013 her honesty was deemed shocking, but refreshing.\n\nNevertheless, top political party leaders in alliance with PKR were certainly not amused with the remarks from the \u201cputeri reformasi\u201d, which were seen as unfair and akin to pouring cold water on their hopes, especially since the 15th General Election (GE15) is much talked about now.\n\nNurul Izzah said it would take up to a decade before Pakatan could return to Putrajaya.\n\nThe first to respond to that was Parti Amanah Negara president Mohamad Sabu, who said the prediction was the 41-year-old\u2019s personal opinion.\n\nThe next day, DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke told a press conference that he disagreed with Nurul Izzah\u2019s defeatist remarks, saying that Pakatan must aim for victory in GE15, even though the road ahead was an arduous one.\n\nShortly after, Nurul Izzah attempted to play down the matter by saying that she will be \u201camong the happiest in the country\u201d if Pakatan manages to win the next general election.\n\n\u201cThe requirement is having a high voter turnout,\u201d she said in a Facebook post on April 15.\n\nDespite criticism on her prediction, Nurul Izzah still has her supporters within PKR.\n\nFor PKR vice-president Chang Lih Kang, Nurul Izzah\u2019s comment should not be dismissed by the top leadership, as there has to be change from within the party with the general election just around the corner.\n\n\u201cIf things don\u2019t change and we are entering the general election with an old framework, image, narrative and old ways of messaging, I\u2019m not surprised if we take 10 years to recover.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a negative statement. I see it as a timely warning from a colleague that we need to heed. We shouldn\u2019t be complacent nor in state of denial,\u201d said Chang, who is Tanjung Malim MP.\n\nVoter turnout has gradually decreased, as seen in the Melaka election in November last year, which recorded a 65.85% turnout, followed by the Sarawak election the following month that saw only 60.67% of those eligible coming out to vote.\n\nThe turnout took an even bigger dive in last month\u2019s Johor election, which recorded an all-time low of 54.92%.\n\nBarisan Nasional won a two-thirds majority in the Melaka and Johor elections with the low voter turnout, while the same scenario played out in Sarawak, where Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) won 76 out of the 82 state seats.\n\nAnalysts have warned that Pakatan\u2019s disastrous outing in Melaka, Sarawak and Johor could be replicated in GE15 if the turnout remained low and should the Opposition remain disunited.\n\nUmno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan said on Monday that June would the best time for GE15 to be held, as party members were feeling the enthusiasm following Barisan\u2019s landslide victory in Melaka and Johor.\n\nPKR\u2019s Subang MP Wong Chen disagreed that Nurul Izzah was a defeatist. He described the mother of two as a fighter ever since the Reformasi movement started in 1998.\n\n\u201cDefeatism is not part of her character, therefore her comment is probably perceived out of context.\n\n\u201cI think she is voicing real concerns after three state election defeats, with the intention of urging us on the need to change and work harder so as to win back political support,\u201d said Wong.\n\nKapar MP Datuk Abdullah Sani Abdul Hamid, said Nurul Izzah had the right to comment about Pakatan, but he pointed out that history had shown that if Pakatan worked hard, it could prevail, no matter how tough the situation.\n\nAbdullah Sani, who is on the PKR central leadership council and is eyeing one of the four vice-president posts in the party polls next month, gave an example of the 2008 general election, in which Pakatan managed to deny Barisan a two-thirds majority for the first time in history, when it succeeded in echoing the sentiments of most Malaysians about the rising cost of living.\n\n\u201cTo me, anyone can make a statement or give an opinion, but you shouldn\u2019t generalise and you cannot say that fence sitters don\u2019t come out and vote because they are fed up with politics.

        "PETALING JAYA: A decision by Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor to pay for the purchase of parts of the littoral combat ships (LCS) in euros instead of the ringgit cost Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) a net loss of RM13.4mil.\n\nAhmad Ramli was the former managing director of Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd (BHIC) and ex-chairman of BNS, a unit of BHIC.\n\nAccording to Prabhat Kumar of Alliance IFA, which carried out a forensic audit, the loss was a result of currency fluctuation, and could have been avoided.\n\nAhmad Ramli, he said, had agreed to a change of payment for the letters of award (LOAs) in the purchase of the towed array sonar and main surveillance radar system, following a request by Gordon Hargreave, who was the chief executive officer of Rheinmetall Defence Electronic.\n\nBHIC was the 51% partner in Contraves Advanced Devices Sdn Bhd (CAD) and Contraves Electrodynamics Sdn Bhd (CED), with Rheinmetall having 49%.\n\nCAD and CED are the two contractors in the LCS project.\n\n\u201cThe chairman (Ahmad Ramli) could have suggested plenty of available measures to minimise the loss. For example, booking the foreign currency in advance and so on,\u201d said Prabhat, adding that the burden was pushed to BNS \u201cwithout informing and seeking approval from the BNS board\u201d,\u201d he told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).\n\nHe also said Ahmad Ramli could have considered the larger interest of BHIC group, which he was representing, rather than CAD.\n\nThe BNS audit committee, he said, raised concerns about the impact of forex losses on the profitability of the LCS project.\n\n\u201cBut it was in vain \u2013 nobody took any action. As a result of his unilateral (and) detrimental commitment, it was noted that the currency of the said two LOAs were changed from ringgit to euros and resulted in a net loss of RM13.4mil to BNS on that day itself based on the difference in the currency rate,\u201d he added.\n\nPrabhat said Ahmad Ramli\u2019s decision gave the impression that \u201cTan Sri was more inclined to safeguard the interest of CAD\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis resulted in an additional liability on the record of increased ringgit value of the said procurements.\u201d",
        "PETALING JAYA: Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor and Anuar Murad were two key figures named extensively in the declassified forensic audit report by the Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation Berhad (BHIC) on the littoral combat ship (LCS) project.\n\nThe BHIC report said they were the ones who issued letters of award (LOAs) and variation orders (VOs) without getting the views of the technical and commercial teams, nor the LCS steering committee (LCSSC).\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report that came out on Aug 4 on the multibillion-ringgit project had also repeatedly mentioned Ahmad Ramli, Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) managing director at that time, and Anuar, the LCS programme director.\n\nAs a result, these procurement-related decisions were made without any discussion, deliberations or queries, which had a significant bearing on the project\u2019s overall cost, said the BHIC report.\n\nThe report said that the then programme director of LCS, Anuar, took advantage of the situation with the support of his superior, Ramli, \u201cby making arbitrary decisions, disregarding the norms of governance while issuing various LOAs and VOs\u201d.\n\nFormer technical and commercial team members said they were not involved in evaluating the LOAs issued to project subcontractors Contraves Advanced Devices Sdn Bhd (CAD) and Contraves Electrodynamics Sdn Bhd (CED) for major components of the LCS project.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the prices charged by CAD/CED were never cross-verified to assess the quantum of margins made,\u201d said the BHIC report.\n\nFormer BHIC chairman Tan Sri Ramlan Mohamed Ali said Anuar had also determined the composition of the evaluation team.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this reduced the independence while evaluating various proposals,\u201d said the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Anuar would also inform the LCSSC about various essential decisions only after he and Ramli had already made these decisions.\n\nAt least 10 LOAs that favoured CAD/CED were not presented to LCSSC for approval.\n\n\u201cThis might be because the board of BNS had delegated sweeping authority to Ramli to negotiate the terms and execute various contracts with CAD without getting approval from the board before signing the LOAs/VOs,\u201d said the report.\n\nRamlan said that despite the advancement of the LCS programme, the frequency of the LCSSC meeting became fewer over the years.\n\nThe committee did not discharge its responsibilities by analysing and discussing in detail various components of the project during the review of the LCSSC minutes, the report pointed out.\n\nThe committee was simply informed on various matters about the LOAs by Anuar.\n\nIt was noted both men were directors of CAD, while Anuar was the director of CED at the time of signing the LOAs.\n\n\u201cThis is against the basic governance as there was an apparent conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cIt was unusual to note that various LOAs and VOs to CAD/CED were issued with Ramli and Anuar\u2019s signatures, who approved the work description, the progress of work, and the payment request.\n\n\u201cVarious procurement phases through CAD confirmed only Ramli and Anuar were the officers involved.\n\n\u201cAs a result, both had complete control of most of the phases of the procurement cycle, a major sign of the lack of governance and autocratic mode of operation,\u201d said the report.",

        "PETALING JAYA: When Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) Chief Admiral Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Jaafar was about to retire after serving for 40 years, he was offered the plum job as the executive deputy chairman/managing director of Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC).\n\nThe highly respected career officer did not have to think twice.\n\nAbdul Aziz who had reservations about the project.\n\nHe said no to the tempting offer, which would have included a remuneration of over RM80,000 a month and other perks.\n\n\u201cI refused. I was offered to take over from (Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor). I refused and I said no. I did not want to go and eat my (word/decisions earlier),\u201d he told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).\n\nIt was clear from the testimony by Abdul Aziz, 66, that he made the decision because many of the actions by Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS), a unit of BHIC, was allegedly against the interest of the navy.\n\nAhmad Ramli, a former navy chief, is one of the two names implicated and mentioned repeatedly in the PAC report on the RM9bil littoral combat ships (LCS) scandal.\n\nThe other is Anuar Murad, a former navy captain, whose name was mentioned 23 times in the PAC report.\n\nHe was the BNS\u2019 LCS programme director.\n\nIn the 247-page report, Abdul Aziz said he had written 10 letters, including to the then prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, as well as to the Chief Secretary to the Government and the secretaries-general of the Defence Ministry and the Treasury.\n\nNone of them, he said, bothered about his incessant protests.\n\nAbdul Aziz\u2019s main grievance was RMN\u2019s objection to the design of the ships as he felt the navy, as the end user, should have a say but his views were ignored by the contractor, BHIC, which was supposed to build the six LCS.\n\nThe six LCS are supposed to be delivered in stages, with the last one scheduled for 2023, but today, not a single ship is ready and RM6bil has been paid to BNS.\n\nIn his testimony before the PAC in 2021, Abdul Aziz said RMN fought a \u201closing battle, right from the start\u201d with \u201cBoustead (BNS) given the leeway to choose what was right for themselves\u201d.\n\nThe core of the dispute is that RMN had wanted the Sigma design of the LCS by a Dutch firm and the combat management system (CMS) from a French firm but following intense lobbying, BNS had opted for the Gowind design and the SETIS CMS \u2013 both from France.\n\nAbdul Aziz said he felt \u201cvery dejected\u201d as it was claimed then that Ahmad Zahid had agreed to Gowind-SETIS but he had not seen any letter from the then minister expressing preference for Gowind-SETIS.\n\nAhmad Zahid is said to have earlier agreed to the Sigma design.\n\n\u201cThe French design was not a proven design while Sigma was already operational in Indonesia, Morocco and a few other countries,\u201d he said, adding there was also a lost opportunity as the builder had wanted to make Malaysia its hub.\n\nThe Gowind design is by France\u2019s Naval Group, formerly DCNS, which had also built the controversial Scorpene submarines in 2002 for Malaysia.\n\nAbdul Aziz said: \u201cWe had bad experiences with the French, especially with the submarines. I did not want to tell the government that we have been cheated but short of saying it, there was some element there. If anybody were to be in my position, I say you must be ready.\u201d\n\nAlthough he felt \u201csomething gravely wrong\u201d from the beginning, Abdul Aziz did not issue any statements externally but declared that the PAC was the best opportunity to say, \u201cI have registered my greatest disappointment to everyone that was supposed to be listening to me\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I were to build a house, if I say I want that, you will get it done. Betul atau tidak? (Right or not?) The fact that happened (was) the other way around, jelas menunjukkan bahawa tidak telus, (it just shows that it\u2019s not transparent,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his testimony, Abdul Aziz also asked to be put on record that he had called for an investigation into Contraves Advanced Devices Sdn Bhd (CAD) \u2013 one of the two companies appointed by BNS as main contractors for the LCS project. The other is Contraves Electrodynamics Sdn Bhd (CED), in which BNS has 51% stake with the foreign Rheinmetall Group having the other 49%.\n\nThe testimony by Abdul Aziz is serious as he has a shiny 41-year journey as a naval officer, including seven-and-a-half years as RMN chief.\n\nHe was enlisted into the RMN in 1974 soon after graduating from the Royal Military College in Sungai Besi.\n\nAmong the milestones Abdul Aziz had achieved were serving on board nine operational ships at sea, including commanding three of them.\n\nHe was also part of a commissioning crew for four RMN ships \u2013 the fast-attack craft KD Paus at the Hong Leong-Lurssen Shipyard in Butterworth, Penang, in 1976; the multipurpose command and support ship KD Seri Indera Sakti at Bremen Vulkan Shipyard in Bremen, Germany, in 1980; the corvette KD Kasturi at HDW Shipyard in Kiel, Germany, in 1984, and the missile corvette KD Laksamana Muhammad Amin at Fincantieri Shipyard in La Spezia, Italy, in 1999.\n\nOn page 80 of the PAC report, in an apparent reference to Ahmad Ramli, Abdul Aziz said there were many proposals made by the navy regarding 17 main management systems \u2013 10 were agreed and seven disagreed by BNS.\n\n\u201cSo I said \u2018My God.\u2019 Short of telling him, \u2018Being an ex-navy, beliau ini (this person), you are not helping the navy at all,\u201d he said.",

        "BUTTERWORTH: The state government has given out new boats, engines and equipment to 20 fishermen under the Penang South Islands' (PSI) Social Impact Management Plan (SIMP).\n\nDeputy Chief Minister I Datuk Ahmad Zakiyuddin Abd Rahman said the handover for fishermen from the south Penang island took place in stages between Aug 12 and Nov 16.\n\nAhmad Zakiyuddin, who is also the Fishermen Task Force chairman, said the boat aid programme was supposed to be implemented only after the PSI project had obtained its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) approvals.\n\n\"But we made the right call by giving out the new boats and engines to the first group of 20 recipients. The fishermen are satisfied as they can now fish in a safer and more efficient manner.\n\n\"We were informed that the fishermen now catch more fish because they can travel farther and faster, and transport larger hauls.\n\n\"Each boat - with a 27 feet (8.23m) length and 7.4 feet (2.26m) width - has more powerful engines of 90 to 100HP (horsepower).\n\n\"Their positive feedback means the state government has made the right decision to provide boats, engines and equipment under the SIMP scheme,\u201d he said, adding that the move showed that the Penang government was committed to assisting the fishermen and treating the profession with dignity.\n\nAhmad Zakiyuddin said this in his speech before handing over the last four boats to their new owners at a ceremony held at the boat fabrication site at Fibra Marine Manufacturing and Trading in Padang Benggali, Butterworth on Wednesday (Nov 16).\n\nAlso present were Fisheries Department deputy director-general (management) Wan Muhammad Aznan Abdullah, Penang Infrastructure Corporation Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Datuk Seri Farizan Darus, SRS Consortium Sdn Bhd project deputy director Azmi Mohamad and Fibra Marine Manufacturing and Trading Sdn Bhd owner Mohamad Naser Talib.\n\nAhmad Zakiyuddin said 315 tekong (boat owners) registered with the Department of Fisheries from Permatang Tepi Laut, Teluk Kumbar, Sungai Batu and Gertak Sanggul, which are Tier One areas in the PSI development, are eligible to receive boat and engine assistance under the SIMP scheme once the EIA and EMP are approved.\n\nThe remaining 295 fishermen will begin to receive their new boats, engines and equipment after the PSI project has received full approval from the relevant agencies, he added.\n\n\u201cThe Penang government agreed to the early handover after receiving an appeal from a group of fishermen who were in dire need of new boats because their existing vessels and engines were old, damaged and no longer seaworthy.\n\n\"The repair would also be too costly for the fishermen,\" he said.\n\nFajinah Jaafar, 61, from Balik Pulau said her life has changed for the better after receiving the new boat.\n\n\"Life is different, more secure and better now.

I cannot afford to buy a new one now,\u201d she added.\n\nPermatang Damar Laut fisherman Kamarudin Kana Mohd Shariff, 63, said he has been fishing with his second hand fishing boat since the mid-1980s.\n\n\"Now I'm not worried about the waves and strong winds because the new boat is bigger and safer. The engine is also good. I can get home faster when the weather changes,\" he added.\n\nHe said that he was grateful to the Penang government for providing him with the new boat.\n\n\"Work is great now.

Secondly, I have other matters to attend to, that is why I left the House.\n\n\"But, it was interpreted as me being ordered out of the House. That is not true at all,\" said Tajuddin.\n\nHowever, Tajuddin said when Rashid announced his suspension from Parliament several days after the incident, he decided to keep quiet as he did not feel like speaking on the matter any more.\n\n\"I did not want to waste time. So, whatever he said, I kept quiet.\n\n\"Honestly.

That is why my vote should be counted during that session,\" added Tajuddin.\n\nIn response, Azhar said he had watched a YouTube video regarding the incident and he did not blame Tajuddin for not hearing Rashid\u2019s orders, given the intensifying shouting match that ensued in the July 20 incident.\n\nYeoh subsequently stood up and requested to issue a clarification on the matter.\n\n\"I think I agree with what Pasir Salak said for the first time.

        "RAUB: It is the last leg of campaigning for the 15th General Election and Barisan Nasional candidate Datuk Chong Sin Woon is not losing any time in reaching out to as many voters as possible \u2013 including those in the outskirts and remote areas.\n\nIn his battle to be Raub MP, Chong said issues surrounding old infrastructure, land matters and water cuts were the main things that needed immediate attention, which he is offering to solve if he wins.\n\n\"The first thing I will do is to ensure the people of Raub will have water during the coming Chinese New Year,\" he said.\n\nChong said solving water woes in the area required huge funding and Federal-state government collaboration, which is also among his pledges.\n\n\"I will liaise with the relevant state agencies and ensure they are prepared to assist with water tankers at proper locations. This ensures the people get water even when their taps are dry,\" he said, adding this would be a short-term solution for people celebrating the festive season.\n\nOn land matters affecting durian farmers, the MCA secretary-general offered to be the bridge between farmers and the Pahang state government to resolve the problem.\n\nDenying Opposition allegations, Chong said MCA had never run away from the issue despite not having any positions in Raub.\n\nChong said the farmers should give MCA a chance to approach the matter using a different method.\n\n\"Compared with staging protests or dragging the issue to Parliament, we don't want to make things worse to the point that it reaches an impasse.\"\n\nAs land matters are under the state, he said it was best to engage all relevant stakeholders to work out a win-win solution through engagement and talks.\n\n\"The farmers and the people know we have engaged them and are aware of their plight. We know that if we win, we can solve this matter amicably,\" he added.\n\nIn 2020, durian farmers in Raub who had been cultivating land without permits were unhappy over a joint venture between a company and a state entity, saying that the agreement was unfair and would result in the small-scale farmers incurring losses.\n\nThe Pahang government said it had adopted a rational approach to tackle land trespassing involving durian farmers in Raub instead of completely tearing down the illegal farms.\n\nLast year, the farmers initiated a lawsuit to defend their rights.\n\nChong also noted the need to develop downstream activities of durian farming to create more economic activities and job opportunities, as \"not everyone in Raub owns a durian orchard\".\n\nAs more youth return to Raub to get involved in agriculture, Chong said the new trend helps the popularisation of urban farming and Malaysia becoming more self-sufficient in food supply.\n\n\"I set up the Koperasi Petani Muda Malaysia (KPMM) or Malaysia Young Farmers' Cooperative in 2014 when I was MCA Youth chief after seeing many youths face problems in the agriculture sector.\n\n\"They were also unaware of the facilities and assistance from the government, making their venture more challenging.\n\n\"This was where KPMM came in, providing free training and helping farmers apply for suitable government grants and loans,\" he said, adding that KPMM could play a more significant role in helping budding farmers.\n\n\"Farming is not a sunset industry. We can develop our agriculture better with Malaysia's weather patterns and fertile soil.\n\n\"We can do more for Raub's development of a sustainable agricultural ecosystem that can maximise the economic sustainability value of the country's agro-food sector,\" said Chong.\n\nHe also pledged to upgrade old infrastructure that often breaks down during heavy rain such as access roads and bridges due to flash floods and landslides.\n\nChong, 48, is in a four-cornered fight for the Raub seat with Chow Yu Hui from Pakatan Harapan, Norkhairul Anuar Mohamed Nor (Gerakan Tanah Air) and Datuk Mohd Fakrunizam Ibrahim (Perikatan Nasional).\n\nFollowing the implementation of Undi18, Raub has some 75,000 voters, mostly from 15 Malay villages, 10 Chinese new villages and five Felda settlements.\n\nThe Raub electorate is 51% Malay, Chinese (36%), Indian (11%) as well as Orang Asli and others (2%).",

The main tender was won by Ericsson in a fair and transparent process.\n\n\"During Ismail Sabri's tenure as prime minister, it was decided that telcos would be invited as investors in DNB.\n\n\"Rafizi does not know what he's talking about.

There are international donors that also do not want to provide funding if the junta is involved.\n\n\"Therefore, the NUG has proposed the establishment of the forum that will enable NGOs to work and funds can be channelled in a transparent manner,\" Saifuddin said after having a video call with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Monday (Nov 14).\n\nSaifuddin said NUG had proposed that the forum be mobilised together with the participation of the UN secretary-general's as well as the Asean special envoy.\n\nHe also said that Malaysia was not satisfied with the development of the five-point consensus, which was not seeing any headway.\n\n\"I told him (Guterres) that Malaysia would maintain our proposed framework which has clear objectives and an end game.

There are so many local issues that have not been addressed,\" Quek said during a site visit to a one-lane bridge in Balok Makmur, which had not been upgraded in 15 years, causing congestion in the area.\n\n\"It's not supposed to be like this. Indera Mahkota is a big township. We have a good port and the MCKIP (Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park) is great.

Prathap said during Liow\u2019s tenure as MP from 1999 to 2018, there were many business and job opportunities for youths.\n\n\u201cHe assisted the Indian, Malay and Chinese community. No one was left out.

Issues like the size of the farm would have to be decided.\n\n\"If we can set up the farm in Batam, it will not take a long time to bring live chickens to Singapore,\" he added.\n\nLast month, the director-general for animal husbandry and health at Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry, Dr Nasrullah, told The Straits Times that a team from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was in Indonesia on June 14 to assess some farms, slaughterhouses and processing facilities.\n\nSuryo was speaking to reporters at Leong Hup Distribution's fully automated warehouse in Fishery Port Road, where the first shipment of frozen chicken from Indonesia arrived on Sunday.\n\nSuryo said the consignment of 50 tonnes of frozen chicken came from Jakarta. The Straits Times understands that they have already been sold out, with chicken rice stalls forming the bulk of the buyers.\n\nMore shipments are set to arrive in the weeks ahead.\n\nSuryo said he expects a total of 1,000 tonnes of frozen chicken to arrive in Singapore by the end of the year.\n\nFor comparison, Singapore imported close to 73,000 tonnes of chicken from Malaysia in 2021.\n\nOn June 30, the SFA approved Indonesia as a new source of frozen, chilled and processed chicken meat for Singapore, joining a list of more than 20 accredited countries such as Brazil, Thailand and Australia. Previously , Indonesia had exported only salted eggs to Singapore.\n\nThis came after Malaysia banned the export of whole chickens from June 1, in a bid to stabilise price and supplies in the country. Wet market poultry sellers in Singapore had to turn to selling frozen chicken.\n\nPrior to the ban, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply came from Malaysia, with most chickens imported live and slaughtered here.\n\nAlthough Malaysia has since allowed exports of kampung and black chicken, the more common and affordable broiler chicken - which makes up the majority of Singapore's imports from Malaysia - remains banned.\n\nDr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment and Manpower , who was at the Leong Hup Distribution facility, said the authorities are monitoring the demand for Indonesian frozen chicken and will step up imports if needed.\n\nAlfred Leek, procurement director at Leong Hup Distribution, said the frozen chickens from Indonesia are bigger - 2kg to 2.3 kg - than those his company imports from United States, Thailand, Brazil and Argentina, which are about 1.5kg to 1.6 kg.\n\nIt takes four days for the frozen chicken to be shipped from Indonesia, compared to 30 to 60 days from the United States, Brazil and Argentina.\n\nMr Leek said that the batch from Indonesia is the first time frozen chickens are being brought in with the head and feet intact. \"The industry now has a new option,\" he said.\n\nProfessor William Chen, director of Nanyang Technological University's food science and technology programme, said the chicken export ban from Malaysia has helped Singapore look for new sources more proactively.\n\nHe added: \"Having frozen chicken from Indonesia opens a new supply source as Indonesia has not been a main supplier of chicken to Singapore so far.\" - The Straits Times/ANN",

        "SIX million Selangor residents and registered voters will be covered under the Insan general insurance scheme launched by the state government.\n\nInsan is a group general insurance coverage scheme implemented by the state\u2019s government agency, Menteri Besar Selangor Inc (MBI), and is open to individuals from young as a month old (30 days) to 80 years.\n\nThe coverage is officially open for registration via the Wavpay e-wallet app which can be downloaded from the App Store, Google Play Store and Huawei AppGallery.\n\nDuring the launch by Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari at the Selangor Penyayang tour at Sultan Suleiman Stadium, Klang, yesterday (Oct 23), he said: \u201cThis is our seventh stop of our nine-district tour since beginning in June this year at Hulu Langat to empower Selangorians by creating job opportunities and stimulating economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to create a compassionate state and society through programmes that aren\u2019t solely focused on welfare but also giving Selangorians the ability and tools needed to succeed and thrive.\n\nThis year\u2019s Selangor Penyayang tour has a total of 44 programmes covering a range of aid, activities and services from various government agencies and subsidiaries for health, education, housing, entrepreneurship (or small businesses) and child care.\n\nInsan is the latest iteration of these programmes which aims to cover Selangorians in case of emergencies. With a population of 6.56mil based on last year\u2019s census, Insan will insure at least 90% through the six million eligible citizens.\n\nProviding Selangorians with free general insurance coverage will help lift their financial burden so they can spend on other essentials like education and healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe started this Insan coverage scheme because we\u2019ve learnt from experience through Covid-19 and the floods that we need to protect our citizens and that they need to be aware how important protection is during uncertainties,\u201d Amirudin said.\n\n\u201cSo far, 40,000 individuals have registered and we expect to cover a million Selangorians by this November.\n\n\u201cAs long as there\u2019s sufficient info when you register, it won\u2019t take longer than 48 hours for the application to be approved,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lnsan scheme offers free coverage up to RM10,000 for death and permanent disability caused by an accident, including funeral expenses up to RM1,000.\n\nMBI will monitor and supervise Insan\u2019s implementation throughout Selangor by collaborating with the central state assembly and the Selangor state assembly coordinator.\n\nWavpay chief executive officer Brahma Shakthi noted that the process was made as simple and convenient as possible for the applicants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing the platform and acting enabler for digital services and programmes like Bingkas and now Insan.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digital growth and a digital platform is the most feasible way to reach six million people.\n\n\u201cToday (Oct 23) marks the official launch and education and awareness of Insan begins tomorrow so that we can smoothen the onboarding process,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the Selangor state government\u2019s officially endorsed cashless wallet, Wavpay has helped execute Bingkas Selangor \u2013 an assistance programme which distributed RM300 every month for struggling families to get household essentials.\n\n\u201cLess than 3% of Selangorians don\u2019t have a smartphone which means it\u2019s already accessible and now it\u2019s just a matter of knowledge and digital savvy.\n\n\u201cWe know we already have Selangorians using the app through the Bingkas programme so now it\u2019s just about getting them activated and getting them protected,\u201d Brahma added.",
        "KLANG: Among the many PKR divisions where tough party election fights are expected, the Gombak division will be one in the spotlight.\n\nCurrent Gombak PKR chief Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari will square off against former Perak PKR chief Farhash Wafa Salvador Rizal Mubarak for the division's top spot.\n\nWhen contacted, Farhash said he had decided to contest the division\u2019s top post because Gombak was very important for PKR.\n\n\u201cGombak has always been the epicentre of the Reformasi movement since its early days in 1998 and so it was unfortunate that the key conspirators in the 'Sheraton Move' came from that division and were led by (Gombak MP) Azmin Ali (Datuk Seri) and (Gombak Setia assemblyman) Hilman Idham,\" Farhash said.\n\nHe added that the turn of events had resulted in Gombak being left in a quandary and without a bulk of its leadership.\n\n\u201cThis was not only because of the Sheraton Move, which saw sizable defections as well as membership terminations of those found to have conspired against the party and Pakatan Harapan, but also internal issues,\" alleged Farhash.\n\nGiven this, he added that he was compelled to do his part to patch things back together again as well as to reignite unity among party members.\n\nAccording to Farhash, there was an acute need to reassure members of a leadership that will be with them during trying times as well as with the ability to propel the party forward as a united front.\n\nAs for his aspirations for the party, Farhash said it was mainly to cultivate unity and togetherness.\n\n\u201cThis is not specifically for Gombak, but what we need within the party as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have multiple leaders working towards various missions or divisions doing their own thing.\n\n\u201cI have been consistent in my stand that this is not about myself and that we need to put aside our personal missions and form a united front to face upcoming challenges,\" said Farhash.\n\nHe added that he believed that the Gombak division needed to be revitalised.\n\nFarhash said he has taken on the challenge to bring change to the division due to the requests of members from Gombak and Ampang.\n\n\u201cI decided to take up the challenge in Gombak and together with my team, I am fully committed to it.

        "SELANGOR government will not arbitrarily absorb debts from housing developers to solve problems regarding strata ownership.\n\nSelangor housing, urban well-being and entrepreneur development committee chairman Rodziah Ismail said the state government would assess each individual case and factors favouring both the state and purchaser so that strata titles could be issued.\n\nShe cited a case involving a strata ownership problem in Taman Putra Perdana, Sepang, where the state government absorbed the land premium owed by the original developer.\n\nShe said a task force, set up in January this year with the Selangor Land and Mines Office (PTGS) to solve such issues, had 611 pending cases.\n\n\u201cMany of the cases involved development that were over 20 years old,\u201d she said, citing one solved case in Putra Perdana involving 12,845 buyers.\n\n\u201cThis is because at that time, developers were allowed to proceed with the construction before settling the land premium.\n\n\u201cMost of the original developers had dissolved or did not have enough funds to submit the entire strata title application,\u201d Rodziah said in replying a question by Halimey Abu Bakar (PH-Seri Setia) at the Selangor state assembly. Halimey wanted to know the state\u2019s solution to strata title ownership problems.\n\nRodziah said new developments were not given such leeway, as work could only start after the land premium had been paid and the strata title had to be transferred in a year after completion.\n\nShe said the task force helped to identify and classify the problems accordingly before further action was taken.\n\n\u201cFor example, some cases are due to the liquidator\u2019s inaction. The court order on liquidators did not include a deadline, resulting in some liquidators dragging the case and eventually expecting the state to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cI will propose an enactment to set a deadline for liquidators to settle the problem, failing which a new liquidator will be appointed,\u201d she said.\n\nRodziah said other causes of delay included buyers not being able to afford the Memorandum of Transfer fees and failing to meet requirements by PTGS due to problems such as applications by non-bumiputra buyers for designated bumiputra lots.\n\n\u201cWe have advised the task force to set up a war room to solve the problem as soon as possible, at least in the next two years,\u201d she added.\n\nElizabeth Wong (PH-Bukit Lanjan) raised a question on how the state had prioritised the cases, citing an ownership title problem in Taman Daya, Selayang, that was more than 30 years old.\n\nShe said there were apartments, shoplots, houses and a condominium built on government land in Taman Daya.\n\n\u201cI brought up the case at the Gombak land and district office in 2018 but they have yet to call for a meeting,\u201d said Wong.\n\nRodziah replied that it was likely a case where the state was involved in a joint venture with a developer, and that the developer had failed to pay the land premium.\n\n\u201cIf the development was built on government land, it will be categorised as illegal. I will check on this case,\u201d she said.",
        "AMPANG: At the age of 18, most students know very little about politics.\n\nBut Ivone Low Yi Wen was different. While studying for her A-Levels, she decided to join MCA after realising that only politics can bring about big changes to improve lives and uplift society.\n\nNow the 29-year-old career politician is in the news.\n\nAs the Wanita MCA spokesman and Beliawanis bureau chief, Low is one of the \u201cyoung candidates of quality\u201d to contest in the 15th General Election (GE15) on Nov 19. In fact, she is among the youngest newbies MCA is fielding under the Barisan Nasional banner.\n\n\u201cI have been actively involved in politics and youth activities since I was 18. I knew that only politics could bring about change. Politics, policy and law-making affect every individual, whether you take part in it or not,\u201d says Low.\n\nAlthough she has put in 10 years of work for MCA and the Ampang community, Low is not widely known outside political circles until Nov 2 when she was announced as the Barisan candidate for the Ampang parliamentary seat.\n\nHer entry into the fray has added spice to kopitiam chatter. At the popular 126 Mewah Food Court located close to three Ampang Yong Tau Foo stalls, the largely Hakka-speaking locals call the youthful-looking Low liang moi (pretty girl).\n\n\u201cMost of us do not know her well. But we know her father and grandfather, and uncles. They are all local MCA leaders,\u201d said a retired businessman who was having breakfast there.\n\nLow says even her mother\u2019s side of the family is involved in MCA politics. But within MCA, she is known to be an Energizer youth bunny, helping to solve women\u2019s problems and issuing hard-hitting press statements on behalf of the MCA women\u2019s wing.\n\nLow, armed with a law degree from the University of London, also offers legal aid. She is particularly concerned about domestic violence, problems faced by single mothers, and discriminating laws against overseas-born children of Malaysian women.\n\nHer responses to current issues are quick and on point.\n\nA search on social media turned up myriads of Low\u2019s videos and posts, whereby she speaks on issues in fluent English, Bahasa Malaysia and Mandarin.\n\nLow is unapologetically outspoken. She shocked many in 2016 when she slammed the Bagan divisional chief from Wanita Umno for suggesting that top posts for government-linked firms must be reserved for Malays.\n\n\u201cThe government belongs to and represents all Malaysian citizens irrespective of ethnicity and religion. The government is not a private ownership solely belonging to Wanita Umno,\u201d said Low in the well-publicised statement.\n\nLow, who proudly calls herself an anak jati Ampang, says her plans are to help solve the age-old problems plaguing this neglected, under-developed town, where New Villages are dotted with rickety wooden houses and grotty backyard industries.\n\n\u201cThis is a forgotten township with many underprivileged folks. Their concerns are just as valid as voters in any other constituency,\u201d she says.\n\nLow has identified three problem areas: poor infrastructure, slow economic growth, and the lack of welfare for children and women, especially in Pekan Ampang and Kampung Melayu Ampang.\n\n\u201cAs a 21st century politician, I have fresh ideas on how to shape the economy here for the younger generation while addressing issues affecting the voters,\u201d she says.\n\nOutside of politics, she enjoys singing, and has used her talent to raise funds for charity.\n\nChallenges are aplenty for Low who will face former Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin, who won Ampang in the last election on a PKR ticket. This time around, Zuraida is contesting under Parti Bangsa Malaysia.\n\nLow will also meet seasoned PKR politician Rodziah Ismail who won the Batu Tiga state seat in 2018 and served in the Selangor state exco.\n\nLow also faces old hands Sasha Lyna Abdul Latif (Perikatan Nasional) and Lai Wai Chong (Warisan), as well as Nurul Ashikin Mabahwi (Pejuang) and independent candidates Muhammad Shafiq Izwan Mohd Yunos, Tan Hua Meng and M. Raveendran.\n\nWhile these candidates may sound intimidating, changing political dynamics at national level can mean that nothing is static in this racially mixed constituency of 132,000 voters (56% Malays, 35% Chinese and 7% Indians).\n\n\u201cBarisan\u2019s track record in delivering promises on development and economic stability speaks for itself,\u201d says Low. \u201cAnd Ampang voters want a highly motivated MP who can do a good job.\u201d\n\nAs the election campaign progresses, Low may discover more challenges. But she is undaunted.\n\n\u201cWith my party elders\u2019 experience and my energy, we can overcome all challenges,\u201d she says.",
        "THERE were no flood incidents in the Batu Tiga constituency on Saturday (Aug 20) though some drains were filled with water that threatened to spill over, says its assemblyman Rodziah Ismail (pic).\n\n\u201cI was told that water rose to high levels in the drains of neighbourhoods near the Central Sugar factory in Shah Alam, but fortunately, there were no floods.\n\n\u201cThe affected housing areas were Taman Batu Tiga and Pangsapuri Indah Ria.\n\n\u201cI contacted the Irrigation and Drainage Department (DID) to speed up their river deepening works at the Sungai Damansara tributary, as the spillover from that tributary usually leads to flash floods to the nearby housing areas,\u201d she added.\n\nRodziah said Batu Tiga was among areas identified by the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) and Federal Government to undergo flood mitigation upgrades.\n\n\u201cThe constituency was badly affected by the massive floods in December last year. So I hope DID and other relevant agencies will speed up their river deepening and mitigation works to prevent floods from recurring.\n\n\u201cMy office has a squad on standby that will be activated to assist people in cases of floods,\u201d she said.\n\nRodziah, who is also Selangor housing, urban wellbeing and entrepreneur development committee chairman, said this at the Selangor Saring health screening programme at Dewan Heritier in Section 24, Shah Alam.\n\nHeavy rainfall on Saturday led to water rising in parts of Taman Sri Muda.

        "SELANGOR has the most number of abandoned or \u201csick\u201d housing projects based on statistics released by the National Housing Department as at Oct 21, 2022.\n\nAccording to the Housing and Local Government Ministry, a \u201csick\u201d housing project is one that has been delayed by more than 30% of its scheduled process or where the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) has lapsed.\n\nThere are 387 \u201csick\u201d projects in the country. Out of this number, the department listed 73 in Selangor with 14,774 units involving 7,423 buyers.\n\nSelangor also has 62 delayed projects comprising 9,842 units and affecting 6,496 buyers.\n\nDespite holding pole position with the most number of \u201csick\u201d housing projects in the country, statistics further show that in the same period 674 housing projects with 134,007 units were launched in Selangor involving 59,710 buyers.\n\nOverall, there are 816 licensed housing projects in the state.\n\nCLICK TO ENLARGE\n\nIn Peninsular Malaysia within the same period, the department identified 3,020 projects licensed by the ministry but only 2,444 projects were launched.\n\nIn comparison to figures in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, there were 3,541 licensed projects, 2,831 launched projects and 365 sick projects in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThis shows a marginal decline in the number of licensed projects and launched projects today.\n\n\u201cThis means that the rate of projects becoming problematic spiked despite a fall in total licensed and launched developments,\u201d said National House Buyers Association (HBA) honourary secretary-general Datuk Chang Kim Loong.\n\n\u201cWith 387 \u2018sick\u2019 projects against 2,444 launched projects, it indicates that the fate of nearly 16% of house buyers is determined by errant developers.\n\n\u201cHence for every 100 housing projects launched, 16 projects are diagnosed as \u2018sick\u2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to statistics, there are 56 \u201csick\u201d high-rise strata projects involving both private and government developers including Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd (SPNB) and PR1MA Corp Malaysia as at Nov 15, 2022.\n\n\u201cThere may also be other government-linked housing agencies under different entities such as Rumahwip (Federal Territories Affordable Housing Project) where developers and contractors create separate legal entities for each project undertaken although these may not be indicated in the statistics,\u201d said Chang.\n\nSelangor and Johor have the most number of \u201csick\u201d high-rise strata projects at 13 followed by the Federal Territory at 11.\n\nThe data also shows that there are three ailing landed strata housing projects in Selangor.\n\nHowever, in the last few years, there have been reports of white knight property developers stepping up to rescue some of the abandoned development in Selangor especially in Klang.\n\nLast year, Selangor housing, urban well-being and entrepreneur development committee chairman Rodziah Ismail in a StarMetro report said that Klang topped the list with 39 abandoned projects, Kuala Langat was second with 20 and Hulu Langat in third place with 13.\n\nAs at Sept 30, statistics reveal 10 \u201csick\u201d housing projects involving 3,914 units and 2,685 buyers in Selangor which are in the process of being revived.\n\nCovid-19\u2019s role in situation?\n\nOn whether the statistics are an accurate reflection of the crisis, Chang said the Covid-19 pandemic and various movement control orders in 2020 and 2021 affected the economy including the housing sector.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the housing market and broader property sector had been weak even before the first MCO was imposed on March 18, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic was a global event which brought difficulties to all economic sectors.\n\n\u201cMost of these housing projects were launched before the pandemic and developers had not expected their projects to be forestalled by the pandemic, disrupting supply chains and manpower,\u201d he said.\n\nBut what is causing the increase in \u201csick\u201d residential projects?\n\nChang cited a news portal report earlier this year stating that the main cause was financial constraints that developers had faced during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe report also cited poor management, rising building material cost, lack of manpower and unsuitable locations.\n\n\u201cCiting unsuitable locations is a poor excuse. Pandemic or not, the project location does not change.\n\n\u201cWhen a developer embarks on a project, it would have done its costing with regards to building materials and the timeline on completing the project as well as feasibility and viability studies,\u201d he added.\n\nLook for completed units\n\nChang said the number of \u201csick\u201d housing projects in the country was reflective of some developers over-promising and under-delivering in situations beyond their control although most of these projects started construction before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cOne property consultant has advised that if there is a need to buy a house, buy a completed unit which you can see and touch. Do not buy off-plan (buying a property based on plans that are available for inspection).\n\n\u201cHis rationale is that some developers want to make as much sale possible.\n\n\u201cMany people buy units off-plan because of the many incentives offered by developers but these are just sales gimmicks. It is important not to fall into the \u2018getting the best choice, the best floor or the best view,\u201d he added.\n\nIn contrast, when people buy completed units, Chang said they could see the plus points and negative aspects.\n\n\u201cYou know more or less what you are going to get,\u201d he added.\n\nEffects on buyers\n\nHouse buyers of abandoned properties run the risk of owing banks the amount that is drawn down and paid to rogue developers.\n\n\u201cThey have to continue servicing partially drawn down housing loans or risk being blacklisted by Bank Negara and the banking system.\n\n\u201cHouse buyers renting homes also have to keep paying rent resulting in emotional stress and financial constraints for them.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, banks suffer when the borrowers cannot service their housing loans. Worse still, the uncompleted houses have zero cash-able value,\u201d he said.\n\nChang said banks suffered more as they were in possession of collateral parcels of land (where houses are built) that could have multiple charge holders.\n\n\u201cIt becomes virtually impossible to cash out to recover the banks\u2019 expenses,\u201d he said.\n\nProposal for risk mitigation\n\nSelangor has the bulk of abandoned housing problems due to massive development taking place in the state.\n\nNational Association for Abandoned Property Owners (Victims) chairman Dr Mohamed Rafick Khan Abdul Rahman said 52,000 house buyers nationwide were still affected by delayed, problematic or abandoned housing issues.\n\nHe said Victims had submitted a proposal on solutions to address problematic projects brought on by cash flow issues including a suggestion for a pre-SPA contract.\n\n\u201cWith this approach, the number of potential house buyers becoming victims reduces tremendously. This is part of a risk mitigation strategy. The paper is with the department for its consideration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith this proposal, we hope developers will have generated enough sales before starting construction. Financial problem faced by developers is the biggest cause of abandoned housing projects,\u201d he said, adding others were due to technical issues on site and cheating.\n\nWatch out for StarMetro\u2019s second story on the details of the proposal soon.",
        "Ampang voters want bigger say in planning community\u2019s future and next MP to really listen to their concerns.\n\nRESIDENTS living along the forested hillside areas of Ampang Jaya, Selangor have four main pillars of concern for the future of the constituency, namely local governance, environment, sustainable economic development and community.\n\nAmpang Jaya Rimba Collective coordinator Noina Baharuddin said the main aim of the group was looking into local governance and creating awareness of issues such as the importance of people\u2019s rights in respect to local government and the draft local plan.\n\n\u201cWe want the next Ampang MP to look into local plan issues, and in this case, our recent Ampang Jaya Municipal Council Draft Local Plan 2035 (RT2035) which has fundamental flaws such as not adhering to the principles of the National Physical Plan and State Structure Plan.\n\nTaman Tun Abdul Razak in Ampang is known for its greenery and walking trails. \u2014 Photos: ONG SOON HIN/The Star\n\n\u201cWe are now in the final stage of this drafting process, which has gone through multiple objections, but the authorities still refuse to listen.\n\n\u201cThe draft is still in the hands of the local government.\n\n\u201cThe residents and stakeholders are often not included on vital matters that affect the welfare of our neighbourhoods,\u201d she said.\n\nNoina added that the RT2035 draft was not in accordance with Act 172 of the Town and Country Planning Act, which had to follow the national and state plans.\n\nPekan Ampang, located just off Jalan Ampang and a stone\u2019s throw from Kuala Lumpur city centre, is a quaint jumble of old and new structures.\n\n\u201cCandidates can talk about forests, green spaces, urban areas and terrains as well as conserving the environment in their manifestos but all these are not reflected in the current draft plan.\n\n\u201cThese aspiring MPs must listen to our concerns and interests, and they need to remember that the people of Ampang are not just constituents. We are stakeholders and have vested interests here because Ampang is our home.\n\n\u201cMPs and assemblymen will come and go as they are elected by us and they can be replaced by us but the constituents do not change. Elected representatives need to show us the respect we deserve and really understand our issues.\n\n\u201cHe or she has to join us in building a brighter and safer future here,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents here also want the incoming MP to look beyond local issues in Ampang.\n\nCLICK TO ENLARGE\n\n\u201cThe independence of the civil service, judiciary, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Agency (MACC) and other uniformed bodies need to be reinforced as a form of check and balance within the government.\n\n\u201cThe Ampang MP needs to play a role in strengthening the economy and work with relevant bodies to develop long-term goals and not merely a five-year plan,\u201d said Dr Mohamed Rafick Khan Abdul Rahman, 59, who resides in Bukit Antarabangsa.\n\nHe stressed that the next MP must come up with a long-term strategic plan, which is endorsed by various stakeholders and Parliament, to develop the economy, not weaken it.\n\n\u201cI want my MP to work together with others to have a cohesive economic and education plan for Malaysia,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the chairman of the National Association for Abandoned Property Owners (Victims), Dr Mohamed Rafick said the country had been plagued with a deluge of abandoned housing projects.\n\nDr Mohamed Rafick says the Ampang MP must also look beyond local issues.\n\n\u201cToday, there are 52,000 house buyers nationwide who are still affected by delayed, problematic or abandoned home issues.\n\n\u201cWe need to strengthen purchasers\u2019 interest and at the same time, develop a sustainable housing industry.\n\n\u201cA good legal framework will give confidence to local and international buyers,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said in Selangor where the bulk of abandoned housing problem occurs, the state government could play a greater role by enhancing land enactments and forming a joint task force with the Housing and Local Government Ministry.\n\n\u201cThis is logical because there is massive development in Selangor,\u201d he added.\n\nWater disruption is another issue that has been affecting some residents in Ampang over the last decade.\n\nA restaurant owner in Kampung Baru Ampang for the last eight years, Wong Chun Mun, 47, wants the next Ampang MP to highlight this issue in Parliament and find a solution to the chronic problem.\n\n\u201cThese are simple, basic needs that have to be addressed.\n\nNoina says stakeholders in Ampang are often not included on vital matters that affect the welfare of their neighbourhoods.\n\n\u201cIt is not just a state problem.\n\n\u201cWe do not need more housing in Ampang or more development here, it is already overcrowded and the roads are terribly jammed, and worse still, we are dealing with inflation and problems with the economy and flooding.\n\n\u201cI have to deal with frequent water cuts and have to rely on water pump to run my restaurant business,\u201d he said when met during a visit by Barisan Nasional\u2019s MCA candidate for Ampang, Ivone Low Yi Wen, on her GE15 campaign rounds.\n\nLow, a fresh face in politics, said the state and Federal governments must work together and carry out proper planning to overcome water disruption in Ampang.\n\n\u201cIt will involve a lot of research and studies pertaining to how they can direct water from other sources and states into Selangor.\n\n\u201cAs an MP, we can voice our concerns, but issues concerning land and water are under the control of the state government,\u201d she said.\n\nAs far as her campaign trail goes, Low said she had accepted the fact that some voters were hesitant

        "\n\n\n\nAs the former minister in the Pakatan Harapan Cabinet handling the controversial Lynas project, it is surprising to see DAP\u2019s Yeo Bee Yin nonchalantly visiting Bentong, Pahang to give speeches about believing in change and asking voters to give them another chance.\n\n\n\nDuring our visits to Bentong, we have often heard criticisms from the grassroots that DAP representatives were incompetent or \"invisible\". Furthermore, when MCA served the people of Bentong and helped in disaster relief, we have never caught even a glimpse of DAP leaders, except when an election loomed.\n\n\n\nDuring the run-up to the 14th General Election, the DAP Bentong candidate made a series of sweet yet questionable promises, such as: abolishing the Karak Highway Toll, burning down Lynas, reducing petrol prices, and abolishing PTPTN repayment, etc. What happened to these promises in PH\u2019s 22-month-long administration?\n\n\n\nPrior to the election, DAP strongly protested the Lynas rare earth processing plant, using it as leverage to hold street protests and attacked the government. DAP\u2019s Wong Tack even vowed to personally set the Lynas plant ablaze if it was not shut down after they won. In a plot twist, not only did Wong Tack not commit arson, but his colleague Yeo Bee Yin as the Minister of Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change, extended Lynas\u2019 operating license and even approved the additional construction of a permanent disposal facility.\n\n\n\nThus, DAP does not have a good track record of fulfilling its promises, whether in the opposition or in the government, and the people of Bentong are aware of this as a fact now. We hope that the people of Bentong will cast their votes wisely in the next General Election, for a party which stands by its words.\n\n\n\nWong Siew Mun\n\n\n\nMCA spokesperson",
        "MUAR: Rumblings among the DAP grassroots and even some NGOs are growing louder over a \u201cpurge\u201d in the party which will likely see four incumbents being dropped while two others have announced their retirement.\n\nMany in the party claim that those who have served their constituents well all these years should not be removed at this juncture. Instead, they felt the party should work to unite everyone, even those from different camps.\n\nAmong those touted to be dropped or moved include Tan Hong Pin (Skudai), S. Ramakrishnan (Bekok), Cheo Yee How (Perling), Yeo Tung Siong (Pekan Nanas) and Ng Yak Howe (Bentayan).\n\nTwo incumbents, Chew Peck Choo (Yong Peng) and Tan Chen Choon (Jementah), have announced that they will be retiring.\n\nSo far, DAP has announced four incumbents to contest in the Johor election, namely in Paloh, Tangkak, Mengkibol and Penggaram.\n\nThe four are aligned to either state chief Liew Chin Tong or his deputy Teo Nie Ching or Bakri MP Yeo Bee Yin.\n\nParty sources said the \u201cpurge\u201d in Johor DAP started in 2018 when Hong Pin challenged Liew for the state chairmanship and lost by a few votes. In 2021, Hong Pin lost again and did not even make the cut into the state line-up.\n\nTalk has been rife that Senai incumbent Tee Bong Tsong could be moved to Yong Peng.\n\n\u201cWe are also hearing that Teo herself may contest a state seat as part of the succession effort, to take over the state leadership from Liew,\u201d the sources said, adding that among DAP\u2019s safest seats included Skudai, Bentayan and Senai.\n\nThey said Senai would be a convenient seat for Teo, as it was within her Kulai parliamentary seat.\n\nParty leaders, including secretary-general Lim Guan Eng, have brushed off the rumblings.\n\nThe sources said there is a possibility of some candidates being moved to other seats because of seat negotiations with Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda).\n\n\u201cAnyway, none of those being dropped or moved have been involved in any scandal or abuse of power or have failed to perform,\u201d the sources said.\n\nHong Pin, when contacted, said Liew had to explain why he was dropped as he had not been implicated in any scandal or issues before and had served the party and constituents well.\n\n\u201cSo far, three incumbents including me have been told about being dropped. Two others have been left hanging.\n\n\u201cIf he (Liew) is dropping incumbents merely to get rid of those from other factions, this is not right,\u201d he said, adding that DAP\u2019s strategy should be to retain those who have served the people well.\n\nHe said with the strict SOP during Covid-19, people would not even know who the new faces are from DAP.\n\nAsked if he would leave the party if dropped, he said he joined DAP to serve and would continue.\n\nMeanwhile, Johor Indian Business Association president P. Sivakumar said Ramakrishan had served his constituents well in Bekok and also as a state executive councillor when Pakatan Harapan was the government.\n\n\u201cWhy drop him after one term?\u201d Sivakumar asked, adding that DAP, being a multiracial party, should allocate at least three seats each for Indian and Malay candidates.",

But some of the industry operators feel that they are all collectively being punished, because of one or two rotten apples that dump rubbish illegally.\u201d\n\nHe also asked if a study had been carried out to classify the types of industries located within an area and the types of waste generated, as some could be toxic while some non-toxic ones could be recycled.\n\n\u201cThis is not meant to be seen as a punishment, but is a new method to ensure industrial waste is disposed of properly in the correct way and at places licensed to manage this type of waste,\u201d Ng replied.\n\n\u201cMany studies have been done on illegal dumpsites, and most of the waste found there are industrial waste and commercial waste.\n\n\u201cSo there is a need for a new method to ensure rubbish from factories or industrial premises are disposed of properly. The state government welcomes efforts by operators who want to recycle industrial waste that can be recycled,\" said Ng.\n\nNg added that KDEB\u2019s subcontractors appointed to manage unscheduled industrial waste would be equipped with certain gadgets and real-time tracking devices for monitoring and tracking purposes.",

Sudevan, a candidate\u2019s personality matters more than their party.\n\n\u201cWe should vote based on a candidate\u2019s qualities such as their integrity, values, agenda and intent,\u201d the project manager opined.\n\n\u201cI want to see my future MP address more bread-and-butter issues like employment, social issues and inflation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Phoebe Ting hopes that the next MP will look into national economic and finance matters to address the rising cost of living, shrinking value of the ringgit and the increasing prices of everyday goods.\n\n\u201cI hope that the MP will stick to his promises and fulfil all that he pledged during the GE15 campaign period,\u201d said the businesswoman and Bandar Kinrara resident.\n\nA health clinic offering affordable healthcare was also much needed in the constituency, they said.\n\nIt is yet to be built, though Wong said in a social media post that he was informed by the Health Minister that it would be built next year under Budget 2023.\n\nUSJ 3/4 RT chairman YY Tan said, \u201cWe understand that Wong, as an MP, has to focus on national issues such as education and climate change.\n\n\u201cBut he keeps us updated on certain matters, such as the status of the much-needed health clinic in USJ1 and how residents should lobby for it.\n\n\u201cBesides portioning some of his allocation for schools, non-governmental organisations such as our RT get a small share.\n\n\u201cHowever, we have to be accountable and report how the money is spent.\u201d\n\nTan, a company director, said an MP should be approachable, communicable, visible in terms of being on-ground and have a team that was easy to work with.\n\nUSJ 12/2-2F Residents Association (RA) chairman Datuk Nor Azman Abdul Rahman said Wong had been transparent in terms of his allocation expenditure and updating residents on various issues.\n\n\u201cI would like the next MP to work on ensuring stability of economy, addressing cost of living matters and ensuring the younger generation has good job opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nUSJ 6 RA chairman Dr Sairin Salleh said: \u201cAn MP should be forward thinking, creative and innovative in ideas and have strategies to improve the constituency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a need to address issues such as cost of living, climate change, environment and higher use of public transport in Subang,\u201d said the engineer.",

He was announced as PKR\u2019s candidate for the constituency on Oct 28.\n\nThe predominantly Chinese constituency was previously known as Kelana Jaya, before it was renamed Subang in the 2018 redelineation exercise just before the 14th General Election (GE).\n\nThe same redelineation exercise also saw a change in the two state seats within the constituency from Seri Setia and Subang Jaya (under Kelana Jaya) to Kinrara and Subang Jaya (under Subang).\n\nThe seat has been held by PKR since GE12 in 2008 when Loh Gwo Burne won the seat.\n\nWong Chen took over as MP where he won with a large majority of 28,827 in GE13 in 2013 and also won in GE14 in 2018 (92,353 majority).\n\nWong said: \u201cI would like to think my parliamentary works and community activities speak for themselves. These are evident from my social media posts since 2013.\u201d\n\nOn community work, he said his focus was primarily on education and welfare including distributing equal allocations to 51 public schools in Subang and helping flood victims.\n\nIf elected again, Wong said he would want to fight corruption and continue reforming Malaysia, particularly fiscal and economic reforms.\n\n\u201cThe national debt is unsustainable and the economic system needs better strategic policies and greater transparency.\n\n\u201cI would work towards a policy for Malaysia to reach net zero within a decade and then restructure our economy based on a much greener platform,\u201d said the 53-year-old who studied at University of Warwick, United Kingdom.\n\nWhen contacted by StarMetro, likely candidates from Barisan Nasional and Perikatan Nasional (Perikatan) vying for Subang seat declined to confirm their candidacy, preferring that the announcement be done by their respective party leadership.\n\nBarisan is tipped to field its Subang parliamentary coordinator, Dr Kow Cheong Wei, 56, from MCA.\n\nDr Kow previously served 10 years as a municipal councillor and four years as Kinrara assemblyman.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the first things I intend to do if elected is to organise a townhall session every three months to highlight all residents\u2019 issues with agencies such as local councils, the police and the Welfare Department.\n\n\u201cI also hope to expand the Safe City (Bandar Selamat) concept to the constituency. I want to highlight that crime prevention is not only about physical aspects, it also needs a soft approach like negotiations to avoid misunderstandings.\u201d\n\nThe Selangor chapter of the Malaysia Crime Prevention Foundation committee member is a lecturer and food and beverage consultant who obtained his doctorate in biotechnology from Universiti Putra Malaysia.\n\nA Gerakan source said that Chai Ko Thing from its Selangor liaison committee is speculated to contest in Subang under the Perikatan ticket.\n\nChai, a 50-year-old corporate litigation lawyer, had previously contested and lost the Bukit Gasing state seat in GE14, when Gerakan was then still part of Barisan.\n\nFormer journalist Charles CJ Chow, who previously announced that he would contest in Subang as an independent candidate under the Gerak Independent political reform group, pulled out of the race after quitting the movement.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Siti Kasim said: \u201cGerak has no plans to field someone else in Subang. When we interviewed candidates last year, we left it to them to decide where they wanted to contest.\u201d\n\nSiti Kasim herself will be contesting as an independent candidate in Batu.\n\nAbout 230,000 voters are expected to cast their votes in Subang in GE15.

Instead, they should look at her past achievements as Science, Technology and Innovation minister as a benchmark.\n\nEarlier on Sunday (Nov 6), C4 issued a statement citing concerns by the nomination of some politicians running for the upcoming 15th General Election (GE15) and their ties to businesses.\n\n\"The growing trend of business-in-politics and vice versa gives rise to nepotism, cronyism, patronage politics and undue influence of business on policy-making,\" said C4.\n\nFollowing Ng's clarification, C4 released another statement, saying it meant no malice to Yeo, and invited her to engage in open conversations.\n\n\"Ultimately, political parties must remain vigilant in ensuring that the circumstances giving rise to the expansion of the business-political nexus are limited as much as possible, especially if those parties are campaigning on an anti-corruption and reformist agenda.\"",

        "The long-awaited Tobacco and Smoking Control Act was tabled in Parliament on July 27 (2022) by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin.\n\nThe bill, which has been more than a decade in the making, is being touted as a once-in-a-lifetime game-changer as it seeks to not only better regulate items such as electronic cigarettes, but also to introduce a Generational Endgame (GEG).\n\nAs our Members of Parliament (MPs) will be voting on this bill tomorrow (Aug 1, 2022), it is worth recapping the rationale for it and why it should be supported by all MPs, irrespective of political affiliation.\n\nHealth benefits\n\nThe rationale for any tobacco control measure is to ultimately reduce the prevalence of smoking.\n\nAccording to the 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), 4.9 million Malaysians aged 15 years and older are smokers.\n\nThe prevalence is higher among men and those in the B40 category, affecting the health of those in these two groups disproportionately.\n\nThe list of diseases caused by smoking is legion \u2013 from lung cancer to heart attacks and strokes to miscarriages, there is practically no part of the body that is left unharmed.\n\nMore than eight million people are killed by tobacco every year, and to make it worse, more than one million of these are non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke.\n\nGenerational Endgame\n\nThe GEG is designed to reduce the number of individuals who start smoking.\n\nIt is worth recalling that youth are purposely targeted by Big Tobacco because they are more susceptible to marketing.\n\nMoreover, their brains are more sensitive to addictive substances such as nicotine.\n\nOne cigarette is potentially sufficient to turn a curious individual into a lifelong customer.\n\nOriginally, the proposed bill stated that those born in 2005 onwards would be prohibited from smoking, and buying or possessing any type of smoking products \u2013 including electronic cigarettes or vape products \u2013 even after reaching the age of 18.\n\nThe restrictions also apply to shopkeepers and cigarette vendors, i.e. they would be prohibited from selling these products to individuals covered by the ban.\n\nFollowing discussions with various stakeholders, it was decided that the GEG would be delayed and apply to those born in 2007 onwards.\n\nThe two additional years are to ensure that sufficient education and enforcement are put in place in order to help make the GEG a success.\n\nNot an immediate ban\n\nThere are mischievous individuals who are scaremongering by saying that the ban will lead to a drop in revenue for retailers.\n\nAs the GEG is to be introduced in stages, it will have absolutely no impact on current smokers, and thus, will not impact on sales in the short term.\n\nThere is no intention to punish current smokers.\n\nOn the contrary, the legislation will make it easier for smokers to quit, especially as half of all smokers want to quit.\n\nFurthermore, most smokers are supportive of the GEG as they do not want their children to make the same mistake they did.\n\nOne study found that smoking caused RM275bil in loss of productivity. \u2014 123rf.com\n\nRegulating electronic cigarettes\n\nAlthough there are calls by many healthcare professionals to ban electronic cigarettes, the practical thing to do at this stage is to regulate it.\n\nThis is because electronic cigarettes do not exist within existing legal frameworks as of now.\n\nWith the new bill, we can ensure that electronic cigarettes on sale conform to specified criteria that will reduce health risks to users.\n\nWe can also introduce restrictions on colours, flavours and other marketing gimmicks that lead to an uptake in electronic cigarette use by youth.\n\nEconomic savings\n\nFor every RM1 of excise duty collected from cigarettes, the Government spends RM4 on healthcare costs associated with smoking.\n\nWe may collect less than RM3 billion as tax revenue from the tobacco industry, but the cost of only three diseases associated with smoking \u2013 lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease \u2013 are estimated to reach RM8bil in 2030.\n\nThe non-direct costs are even higher \u2013 a study published in 2020 showed that smoking caused RM275bil in loss of productivity.\n\nIllicit cigarettes\n\nThe tobacco industry is very quick to link any and all tobacco control policies with the proliferation of the tobacco black market.\n\nSubang MP Wong Chen is one of many who has dismissed this lazy argument and pointed out that the solution to the black market \u2013 for any product and not just tobacco \u2013 is to increase funding for Customs and border patrols, as well as to to improve governance and effectiveness of the authorities.\n\nTo this end, Khairy has met and received commitment from the Customs Department, the Royal Malaysia Police and the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry on their campaigns against illicit cigarettes.\n\nSlippery slope\n\nSome have raised concerns regarding the infringement of human rights and the possibility that the GEG is a precursor to other interventions, such as a ban on alcohol.\n\nThis is another form of fear-mongering, especially as there are no moves or bills proposing to ban alcohol, gambling or other such activities.\n\nEach legislation must be judged on its own.\n\nAs I wrote in my column last month (June 2022), smoking products are designed to be highly addictive with no safe level of consumption.\n\nThere is nothing else easily available on the shelves that kills half its users when used as intended by its manufacturers.\n\nGroundswell of support\n\nUnlike previous years, there is no doubt that the general public (parents, youth, smokers, non-smokers), the medical profession and non-governmental organisations are all on the same page regarding the Tobacco and Smoking Control Act.\n\nIts introduction, backed by proper enforcement, will lead to future generations where the scourge of smoking and its ill effects are minimised.\n\nAll that remains is for our MPs to vote for the right thing.\n\nAs public health expert Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman recently stated in an open letter to the heads of every major political party in Malaysia, the politicians have a moral obligation to vote in favour of this life-changing bill.\n\nIt is time to ignore the voices of those with vested interests, and help bring about a healthier future for our children.\n\nDr Helmy Haja Mydin is a consultant respiratory physician and the advisor to the Health Minister on Tobacco Control policies.

        "SHAH ALAM: Those expecting a showdown of sorts between PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his deputy Rafizi Ramli during their party national congress have been left disappointed.\n\nDuring his winding-up speech, Rafizi, who is known for his sharp tongue, pledged his loyalty to Anwar and assured him that he would not betray him.\n\nAddressing Anwar directly, Rafizi said he might be loud but he was \u201cnot Datuk Seri Azmin Ali\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr President, I do not make sweet promises and then stab you in the back.\n\n\u201cI have never promised to break down the prison wall to free Anwar,\u201d said Rafizi.\n\nHe maintained that he was not the sort who would make a promise in front of a person and then negotiate for positions behind his back.\n\nIt is believed that Rafizi was referring to a speech by Azmin about a decade ago in which he said that he was prepared to break the prison walls to get Anwar if the party president was imprisoned.\n\nAzmin, who was former party deputy president had led the defection of a substantial number of elected representatives from the party in 2020 which nearly crippled PKR and caused the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan government.\n\nOn Saturday, Rafizi told reporters that PKR members should not resort to \u201capple polishing\u201d Anwar.\n\nPrior to that, he had claimed that research carried out by his think-tank revealed that Anwar\u2019s popularity was waning.\n\nSuch blunt remarks had led to expectations of fireworks at the final day of PKR\u2019s national congress yesterday.\n\nHowever, Rafizi said in his speech he wanted to be judged on his effort, hard work and service to the party even though he did not praise Anwar.\n\nHe also said that he would continue to be sharp-tongued and critical as he did not know how to sweet talk.\n\nEarlier, Rafizi said PKR had worked hard to deliver to the people what they required and deserved.\n\n\u201cThe people know this and they are thankful to us for it.\n\n\u201cBut we have to remember and respect that once we become the government, their expectations of us will become more complicated,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said the people wanted to see how the new government could resolve their problems, adding that this could not be done by delivering mere speeches and ideas.\n\nThe onus was on the new government to use its ability, skills and intellect to prove that it was better than its predecessor, he added.\n\nIt also appears that Rafizi is all set for his task with the help of his loyalists who make up a majority of the elected members in the central leadership council.\n\nThirteen out of the 20 elected central leadership council members for the 2022-2025 term were from a list of 25 names tweeted by Rafizi earlier last week.\n\nAmong them are Johor Baru MP Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, Bakar Arang assemblyman Ooi Tze Min, Simpang Pulai assemblyman Tan Kar Hing, Subang MP Wong Chen, Merbok MP Nor Azrina Surip, Semambu assemblyman Lee Chean Chung and celebrity Datuk Hans Issac.",

No one has seen him play for some time,\u201d said Choong Hann after Malaysia\u2019s first official practice session at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe shall see his form only during this week\u2019s event. It will be interesting.\u201d\n\nYuqi, 26, incurred the wrath of the CBA for his lack of sportsmanship after deliberately conceding a walkover against Kento Momota while trailing 5-20 in the second game (having lost the first 22-20) during China\u2019s Thomas Cup semi-finals against Japan in Aaarhus, Denmark, in October last year. China won the tie 3-1.\n\nThe 2018 World Championships silver medallist made things worse during a post-match press conference where he had claimed he didn\u2019t lose to Momota but the match ended at 20-5.\n\nYuqi was slapped with a one-year suspension from the CBA which was ended earlier and he had replaced former Olympic champion Chen Long for the World Championships.\n\nThe 2018 All England champion is expected to meet Indonesian Anthony Ginting in the last eight and a win is expected to set him up for a mouth-watering clash against top seed Axelsen in the semi-finals in Tokyo.\n\nFormer international Rashid Sidek said it will be an open affair with Axelsen having a slight edge but Yuqi will be the darkhorse of the tournament.\n\n\u201cYuqi\u2019s form is unknown and I believe he is going to be a big threat at the World Championships. He may be the spoiler this time,\u201d said Rashid.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s shuttlers are known to go missing for months and suddenly return to win major events. During my days, Yang Yang used to do this before World Championships and will come back stronger and win (1997 and 1999).\n\n\u201cThe last one to do this was LIn Dan in 2013 where he did not ompete for months and received a wildcard from BWF (Badminton World Federation) for the Guangzhou event and beat (Lee) Chong Wei for the title.\n\n\u201cYuqi is not in the same class as Lin Dan but he\u2019s still a top class player and his presence is going to spell trouble for a few players.\u201d\n\nYuqi himself is not having high hopes and is glad to be back competing on the international stage again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing well and I\u2019m really happy to be in Tokyo. I\u2019m not too nervous. I\u2019m just trying to learn from all my opponents.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a high level tournament, I have a lot to learn from players like Viktor, Momota and Ginting, and a few others too,\u201d Yuqi was quaoted by BWF.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s hopes will be on world No. 5 Lee Zii Jia who does not have to worry about Yuqi.

        "A controversial appointment almost eclipses Anwar\u2019s maiden Cabinet but it is generally a line-up of younger and fresher faces.\n\nTHE most asked question in the last one week has finally been answered.\n\nAnd the answer is: Yes, Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is once again Deputy Prime Minister alongside Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).\n\nThe man responsible for Barisan Nasional throwing its support behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has made a grand but controversial return to the office he occupied from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIt is the mother of all ironies that Ahmad Zahid has gone from zero to hero among Pakatan Harapan supporters. They know that without him, Anwar would not be where he is.\n\nIt has not been easy for Anwar to accommodate the demands of his new partners.\n\nBarisan felt it deserved portfolios that befit its role as kingmaker while GPS had its own Sarawak-centric priorities.\n\nAnwar promised a lean Cabinet but the end result was anything but lean.\n\nThere are a total of 25 ministers with another three portfolios held by the Prime Minister and the two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nIt is only slightly less crowded than the previous 33-person Cabinet.\n\nThe most interesting part of Anwar\u2019s Cabinet was in the economic appointments.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose top priority is economic recovery, is also Finance Minister.\n\nFormer Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Hassan Marican has been roped in as an economic adviser because the reputed technocrat can help inject investor confidence.\n\nPandan MP Rafizi Ramli, whose supporters wanted him for the finance post, is Economy Minister.\n\nThe odd man out in the economic box is International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz who was certainly not in Anwar\u2019s shortlist of candidates.\n\nThis is the second time that Tengku Zafrul, who lost in Kuala Selangor in the recent elections, is making a back door entry into the Cabinet.\n\nIt is a rather mixed bag of personalities that has been entrusted to revive the economy.\n\nThe same could be said for the general line-up, too.\n\n\u201cIt is a line-up of younger and fresher faces especially those from PKR. They will bring down the average age of the Cabinet, making it the youngest Cabinet we\u2019ve had in a long while,\u201d said political commentator Khaw Veon Szu.\n\nIt is also no coincidence that most of the ministers are Malays and Bumiputera.\n\nAnwar understands the power of optics, especially given that the opposition bench is almost entirely Malay and Muslim.\n\nA total of 15 portfolios went to Pakatan with PKR taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nSome think the political animal in Anwar is moving to strengthen his party.\n\nBut the fact is that PKR is a genuinely multiracial party, its leaders are well-educated, they do not harp on race and religion and they represent a Malaysia that many of us want to see.\n\nThose appointed are there on their own merit.\n\nWas it a strategic move for DAP to accept only four ministerships? Was it to puncture accusations that DAP dominates the government?\n\nDAP\u2019s portfolios \u2013 Transport, Local Government, Youth and Sports and Human Resources \u2013 are important and will enable the party to reach out to its base.\n\nIts Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo was said to have declined a seat in the Cabinet.\n\nAnwar\u2019s other concern is to ensure that his government survives a full term and that means keeping his partners contented so they do not get up to any mischief.\n\nBoth Barisan and GPS got almost equal treatment although Ahmad Zahid was obviously the big winner, landing the Rural Development portfolio. It is a coveted ministry because of its outreach to the Malay heartland.\n\nBut some things are not meant to be and Rembau MP Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who many thought would be the Deputy Prime Minister, ended up in Defence.\n\nAnwar has eased into the job quite smoothly, be it the outpouring of support and attention wherever he goes to audiences at the palace.\n\nAnyone else would have been overwhelmed by the sudden transition from Opposition leader to Prime Minister.\n\nHe has also set several admirable dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 open tenders for projects, no new official car, no unnecessary renovations to his office, no gifts and no salary for himself.\n\nThe air is still filled with euphoria over the rise of Anwar and it has been quite comical and sad too to watch Pakatan supporters fall over themselves trying to justify partnering with Umno and downplaying corruption issues.\n\nSome call it pragmatism. Others say it is for the sake of stability.\n\nActually, it is Machiavellian politics at its best where the end justifies the means.\n\nBut nobody wants to see more political instability and that is why Anwar should get a chance to do his job for the next five years.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",

When he tried to deposit them, he found the RM100 notes were fake.\n\nFederal Territory Bumiputera Petty Traders Association president Datuk Seri Rosli Sulaiman said the bulk of victims were hawkers and petty traders who did not have equipment to detect the fake currency.\n\nHe said many of these small traders were reluctant to come forward and make a report because it was a hassle to do so.\n\n\u201cWhen people with fake money come and buy from these traders, it is a direct income loss because they give fake notes and get back legitimate ones.\n\n\u201cThis problem is prevalent among all traders, and usually involves the RM100 and RM50 notes.\n\n\u201cBesides not having a device to detect fake money, the traders are usually also busy with running their business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have no time to check the notes, especially if they are operating in the market or, say, a stall.\u201d\n\nRosli said the authorities, especially Bank Negara Malaysia, should carry out more awareness campaigns about the issue to ensure people do not become victims.\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Association president Ding Hong Sing also said many victims did not want to come forward because of the hassle involved.\n\n\u201cWhen they come across such notes, the authorities will ask them a lot of questions.\n\n\u201cThese victims cannot remember the details due to the nature of their business. They meet so many customers daily.\n\n\u201cIn short, these counterfeit notes are not good for the economy nor the well-being of small business owners,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Yeah Kim Leng, director of the economic studies programme at the Jeffrey Cheah Institute of Sunway University, said the issue of fake currency, if not nipped in the bud, could undermine the country\u2019s monetary and financial system.\n\n\u201cIf the fake currency circulation grows unchecked, there will be a loss of trust in the currency, affecting cash transactions.\n\n\u201cImproved security features would be a key strategy to combat fake notes.\n\n\u201cEqually important is effective policing to track and shut down the syndicates that engage in such illegal activities \u2013 which can be treated as economic sabotage,\u201d he said.",

        "LONDON/GDANSK/KAZAKHSTAN: Seyda Bal, who works at a bank in Istanbul, is so anxious about the rising price of groceries that she's lapsed into a pandemic-era habit: hoarding packaged goods like coffee and toilet paper.\n\n\"I buy a lot of basic foods such as oil, pasta, rice, tahini, molasses ... thinking that next month they will cost twice as much,\" Bal, 27, said.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has propelled energy and grain prices to all-time highs, driving up the cost of packaged goods. That has been felt particularly acutely in parts of Asia and North Africa, where people spend a higher proportion of income on food and fuel than in the United States and Europe, prompting some shoppers to stockpile non-perishable items.\n\nThe trend hasn't gone unnoticed by Nestle, the world's biggest packaged food company and home to more than 2,000 brands including Cheerios, Nescafe and Maggi.\n\nThe Swiss group is adapting its product ranges in the region to \"make them more meaningful to the consumer\", and considering whether to make some products \"more affordable\", according to Karim Al Bitar, head of consumer research and market intelligence at Nestle's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) unit.\n\nThat could include increasing pack sizes and changing to less expensive ingredients.\n\n\"Nestle is seeing hoarding with bouillon, to an extent soups, coffee for sure,\" Al Bitar told Reuters.\n\nMaggi products and Nescafe coffee sachets are among popular products for stockpiling, he added.\n\nNestle is working with local partners to overcome supply challenges and has so far managed to keep stock on shelves, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe MENA region contributes over 4%, or 3.7 billion Swiss francs ($3.9 billion), to Nestle's annual sales. The region that includes Central Asia accounts for about 9%, or 8 billion francs.\n\nSTOCK UP, OR PAY MORE LATER\n\nShoppers are spending less on non-essentials such as electronics, clothes and household goods, while demand for packaged food and personal care items is up, said Hani Weiss, CEO of Majid Al Futtaim Retail, which runs more than 450 Carrefour stores in 16 countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\n\"What does that tell us that people are concerned about? Stock availability,\" Weiss said, adding the retailer was seeing about 9.5% inflation on average, and particular pressure in countries such as Egypt, Kenya and Georgia.\n\nSeveral countries in North Africa and Central Asia are suffering recurring shortages of basic necessities. Euromonitor International analyst Kamile Botyriute said people in Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Morocco were having difficulty finding flour, sugar and baked goods. In August, some shops in Tunisia began rationing items to stop consumers from hoarding, Botyriute said.\n\n\"I have bought about 10 50-kilogram bags of flour and just as much of sugar,\" Eldar, 28, an entrepreneur based in Almaty, Kazakhstan said. \"There are rumors that sugar shortages are expected and I wanted to have a stockpile.\"\n\nIn the same city, Ivan, 47, a furniture designer, said: \"Prices may go up, the dollar (exchange rate) may go up. You start thinking: either I stock up now at current prices or I will have to pay more later.\"\n\nBILLS, BILLS, BILLS\n\nInflation is rising at a faster pace in many Central Asian and North African countries than in North America or Europe, where consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 8.9% in July.\n\nTurkey's annual inflation hit a 24-year high of 80% in August, while Egypt's accelerated to 13.6% in July. In many cases, weakening local currencies are adding to import costs.\n\n\"In Turkey, consumers are adjusting to the reality of extremely high inflation. Despite higher prices, we see consumer demand and market volumes holding up, due partly to pantry loading,\" Unilever CEO Alan Jope said in July.\n\nSinem Ozel, 31, a marketing expert living in Istanbul, has been stocking up on items including oil, toilet paper, pasta, sugar, and dishwasher detergent. She used to spend around 300-400 Turkish liras ($16.71-$22.27) for one month's shopping but now spends the same amount in one week, and sometimes buys Nescafe's three-in-one 20% extra pack of instant coffee.\n\nBut not everyone can afford to hoard.\n\n\"We don't have the money to buy large quantities of stuff,\" Layla, a 60-year-old shopper said, standing in front of Lafayette Market in Tunis, Tunisia. \"Most of the time we have to get a loan from relatives to complete the month.\" - Reuters",

Vivekanathan said Sepang folk wanted more affordable housing.\n\n\u201cNew townships are being built next to their homes in Dengkil, Sungai Pelek, Salak Tinggi and Tanjung Sepat, but the prices are unaffordable.\n\n\u201cEven Rumah Selangorku units are priced at RM200,000 each, which is too high,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that rental had also increased from RM400 to RM1,000.\n\nThe Sepang parliamentary seat will see an eight-cornered fight.\n\nThe candidates are Datuk Seri Rina Mohd Harun (Perikatan Nasional), Raj Munni Sabu (Pakatan Harapan), Datin Paduka Che Asmah Ibrahim (Pejuang), Anuar Basirin (Barisan Nasional), Datuk Mohd Daud Leong Abdullah (Parti Utama Rakyat), Nageswaran Ravi (Parti Rakyat Malaysia) as well as Mohd Syahrul Amri Mat Sari and Muneswaran Muthiah who are standing as Independents.\n\nMost of the candidates have pledged to solve the constituency\u2019s flood problem.\n\nSepang Umno vice-chairman Anuar said he would push the government for a permanent solution.\n\n\u201cI also plan to set up an alarm system to alert residents on rising water levels,\u201d he said.\n\nAmanah Wanita chief Aiman Athirah, whose actual name is Raj Munni, said although frequent floods were topmost on people\u2019s minds, she would also address other issues including affordable housing, high cost of living and lack of infrastructure.\n\nRina\u2019s campaign posters also indicated that flood mitigation would be given priority, besides the provision of recreational and sports facilities.\n\nPejuanita chief Che Asmah, who has held top positions in the Environment Department, promised to look into the constituency\u2019s flood and pollution matters.\n\nPerhaps the candidate who most understands the constituents\u2019 suffering is former Sepang Municipal councillor Mohd Syahrul Amri Mat Sari.\n\nHaving lived in Sepang for the last 12 years, he has promised to work primarily on preventing floods, improving roads and providing more clinics, schools and sporting facilities.",
        "KEPONG: GE15 candidate Yap Zheng Hoe experienced his first taste of being snubbed by constituents during his maiden election campaign at the Kepong Baru market last Sunday.\n\nMaking his rounds at the bustling morning market, some traders and shoppers gave him the cold shoulder while others returned his greetings with indifference.\n\nThe first-time dabbler in the general election found this reception chilling but Yap kept his smile and continued with the pleasantries.\n\nHis reply to an elderly uncle who grumbled aloud that he was \u201ctoo young, too inexperienced\u201d and \u201chadn\u2019t eaten as much rice as he had salt\u201d was brilliant: \u201cYes, I am young, but give me a chance. After all, some people like spicy food, some don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYap\u2019s comeback earned him a few chuckles, and good-natured teasing.\n\nThe 30-year-old contesting under Barisan Nasional in the Kepong parliamentary constituency is a true-blue local boy.\n\n\u201cDeep in their heart, many of the people here know that I have been doing community service for the past 12 years ... ever since I was 18. I am here to stay. This is my home,\u201d he tells The Star.\n\nThe fair, bespectacled Yap runs his own advertising and marketing business, which also has a construction arm. During his down time, he plays badminton and futsal.\n\nKepong has long been regarded as a \u201csure die\u201d constituency, mainly because it is traditionally an anti-establishment area with a history of leftists and fiery opposition politicians from the 1950s to the 1970s.\n\nIt is known that many former political detainees are still living in the area, and they continue to influence local public opinion.\n\nSince 1982, this seat has been consistently won by the DAP.\n\nMCA has never contested in Kepong. This is the very first time MCA is fielding a candidate for this constituency.\n\nIn 1978, Tan Tiong Hong contested under the Gerakan flag, and afterwards in 1981, he switched to MCA for the Raub seat.\n\nBut Yap is undeterred. \u201cI am confident I can do more to help make Kepong a better place to live in. And it has only made me more determined than ever to work harder to gain more support for the coming elections.\u201d\n\nHe proudly points out that the MCA service centre in Kepong, set up in 1964, never stopped serving its constituents despite the fact that after 1982 Barisan has never won the seat.\n\nFor Yap, whose family members are active MCA members, it was only natural to join the party upon his return from the University of York six years ago where he studied business marketing.\n\nShould he win, Yap says he would want to review the development strategy in Kepong.\n\nOne key issue is traffic congestion, which he says is caused by ill-planned development and poor public transportation.\n\n\u201cIf traffic jams are reduced, residents here will have less stress on the road,\u201d he says.\n\nBeing a successful businessman, Yap hopes to help young entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. He is certainly capable of this, given that he is the former vice-president of the Junior Chamber International\u2019s Bukit Bintang branch.\n\nIn the last election in 2018, DAP\u2019s Lim Lip Eng won Kepong with an overwhelming majority, netting 92% of the votes cast. Lim will defend the seat under the Pakatan Harapan banner.\n\nYap will also face Phaang Jing Fatt (Gerakan/Perikatan Nasional), Shaun Young (Warisan) and Kepong Community Centre head Yee Poh Ping who is standing as an independent.\n\n\u201cWith or without a tough opponent, I will do my best to serve the people,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, I will continue to serve the Kepong community. A political career is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d\n\nThis round, 94,000 Kepong voters (86% Chinese, 6% Indians and 4% Malays) will go to the polls on Nov 19.\n\nOn what he wants the voters to know about him, he says: \u201cOne, I am not afraid of hard work. Two, I speak my mind. Three, I am Yap Zheng Hoe \u2013 candidate No.3 for P114 Kepong.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome, \u201cI am proud to be able to represent MCA,\u201d says Yap.\n\n\u201cIt will be another stage of my political career to do more for anak-anak Kepong.\u201d",

He did not respond when asked for comments.\n\nThe PKR vice-president beat Umno candidate Tan Sri Zulhasnan Rafique with a whopping 14,000-vote majority in GE14.\n\nHis victory ended Umno\u2019s grip on the constituency.\n\nIzudin, an unknown candidate, might contest in Setiawangsa.\n\nWhile some quarters are optimistic Nik Nazmi can retain the seat, others say Izudin will put up a good fight.\n\nA community leader and former MPPWP member said both national and local issues would come into play in GE15.\n\n\u201cIn the last elections, PKR was swept to victory by a political tsunami because of public anger over the 1MDB scandal.\n\n\u201cBut since then, more local issues such as complaints over roadside traders under the free trade area initiative have emerged.\n\n\u201cThere is also the Bukit Dinding development issue, which has sparked concerns of over-development in Setiawangsa.\n\n\u201cThe locals want an MP who will speak up on these issues and explain what actions are being taken,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source also said that both Nik Nazmi and Izudin have respective weaknesses that they must address.\n\n\u201cNik Nazmi is more focused on national issues, especially on social media, and lacks a grassroots structure to penetrate the community.\n\n\u201cIzudin, meanwhile, is not well-known and must fight the perception about corruption that is associated with his party,\u201d he said.\n\nApproximately 60% of voters in Setiawangsa are Malays, while Chinese and Indians make up about 25% and 15%, respectively.\n\nSetiawangsa is also home to a sizeable number of civil servants, thanks to the army quarters opposite the Mu\u2019adz Jabal mosque.\n\nAn activist, who runs a non-profit to help local poor, said Barisan Nasional could no longer count on these people as its fixed deposit.\n\n\u201cAlthough civil servants were typically assumed to be Barisan supporters, recent political developments have changed that.\n\n\u201cCandidates who are closer to the community and aid the needy are preferred,\u201d he added.\n\nTalk is rife that former television host Nurul Fadzilah Kamaluddin will be joining the political fray as a Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) candidate.\n\nA news portal reported that the Bersatu Srikandi Muda (young women) chief was also active in non-profit works.\n\nA source said Bersatu lacked a clear narrative and was unlikely to make much impact.\n\n\u201cUndecided fence-sitters might vote for it, but the main battle is between PKR and Barisan,\u201d he said, adding that Bersatu lacked the machinery and grassroots workers to mobilise its campaign.\n\nHe also said that Nik Nazmi\u2019s resounding majority in the last polls showed that PKR was still a force to be reckoned with.",

Mahendran taking the stand to tell of multi-million ringgit payouts to the former deputy prime minister.\n\nThe case had been postponed on July 29 after Mahendran, the prosecution\u2019s final witness, came down with Covid-19.\n\nMahendran told the High Court yesterday that Ultra Kirana Sdn Bhd (UKSB) had paid a total of S$13.56mil (RM43.84mil) to Ahmad Zahid between Oct 2014 and March 2018.\n\nThe money was paid in monthly instalments.\n\nMahendran said the amount given to the former deputy prime minister was between S$200,000 (RM646,616) and S$520,000 (RM1,681,203) each month.\n\nHowever, he added that the amount was increased to S$300,000 (RM969,925) beginning in March 2015 upon Ahmad Zahid\u2019s request to UKSB former directors VK Lee and Wan Quoris Shah Wan Abdul Ghani.\n\nThe company increased the amount to S$520,000 (RM1,681,203) from July 1, 2017.\n\nMahendran, who was reading his written statement, said Ahmad Zahid had also received RM3mil in cash on March 27 from UKSB for the 2018 general election campaign.\n\nThe political funding, he said, was one of several one-off payments.\n\nOther one-off payments, according to Mahendran, included RM125,000 for a Hari Raya celebration in June 2014, S$1mil (RM3.2 mil) in May 2017 to celebrate Umno\u2019s 71st anniversary, S$30,000 (RM97,000) in October 2017 for Ahmad Zahid\u2019s wife\u2019s birthday celebration; and S$120,000 (RM388,000) and 15,000 Swiss francs (RM70,122) in Aug 2015 and May 2016, respectively.\n\nThese one-off payments were in addition to the monthly payments amounting to S$13.56mil (RM43.84mil).\n\nAhmad Zahid is charged with 33 counts of receiving bribes from UKSB during his tenure as Home Minister in order to extend the company\u2019s contract to continue operating the one-stop centre in China and the foreign visa (VLN) system.\n\nThe alleged graft was also to ensure that the company\u2019s contract agreement for the supply of the VLN integrated system continued.\n\n\u201cAs Home Minister at that time, Ahmad Zahid had the power and influence to formulate policies and direction of the government, especially the Home Ministry,\u2019\u2019 said Mahendran.\n\nHe added that any decision by Ahmad Zahid would affect UKSB\u2019s business directly or indirectly.\n\nMahendran said based on the relevant witnesses\u2019 testimonies and UKSB\u2019s ledger, the monthly payments were handed to Ahmad Zahid at his private residence in Country Heights, Kajang or at the deputy prime minister\u2019s official residence in Putrajaya.\n\nThe proceedings, before judge Datuk Mohd Yazid Mustafa, also heard that UKSB\u2019s former administration manager David Tan Siong Sun had codenamed Ahmad Zahid as Monster, Mon, YB, Young Boy, \u201cZH\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d in the ledger.\n\nMahendran stated that the MACC investigations were conducted in accordance with Section 16(b)(B) of the MACC Act, as it is illegal for those in positions of public trust and civil servants to accept bribes.\n\nThe hearing continues today.",

The government's role is to provide the infrastructure for us to realise the energy transition,\" he said.\n\nThe government, he said, should also look into the monetary needs of its agencies, which were responsible for protecting the environment, to enable them to operate effectively as well as to invest in research and development activities by capitalising universities, research group and non-governmental bodies.\n\nEchoing the same views, environmentalist Leela Panikkar said the government should explore avenues to include the community in the bid to build a sense of shared responsibility in protecting the environment.\n\nShe said it could be achieved via allocation for communities to develop local conservation programmes, especially in rural areas.\n\n\"Preservation of the environment could be a boost to the country's tourism industry, especially through eco-tourism,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Pertubuhan Alam Sekitar Sejahtera Malaysia president Mohd Yusaimi Md Yusof said that the funding should be channeled towards the acquisition and development of new environmental technologies.\n\nThe environmental impact of new infrastructure investment should also be taken into account in the budget\u2019s tabling, he added.- Bernama",

He\u2019s helped buy over Umno\u2019s stake in companies like KUB Malaysia in 2019 to help the party stay afloat after some of its bank accounts were frozen in relation to the 1MDB scandal.\n\nJohari lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 but won it back in the 15th General Election (GE15) as he was seen by the majority Malay voters in the district as a capable administrator.\n\nRafizi Ramli, 45\n\nRafizi was swept up in the \"reformasi\" movement protesting Anwar\u2019s sacking as deputy prime minister in 1998. He worked as an accountant with state oil and gas producer Petronas for about six years before quitting to focus on politics with Anwar and his party, PKR.\n\nHe was elected to Parliament in 2013 and focused on exposing corruption related to Najib and his government, including 1MDB.\n\nHis revelations helped fuel public anger against Umno and led to its historic defeat in GE14 in 2018, though he was ineligible to defend his seat as he was appealing a jail sentence for leaking contents of a 1MDB audit report. He was acquitted in 2019.\n\nRafizi returned to the political fray earlier this year. His team swept most of the positions in PKR and he now holds its powerful deputy president position.\n\nTan Sri Azman Mokhtar, 61\n\nAzman Mokhtar worked at Malaysia\u2019s electric utility and cycled through a series of finance jobs before taking the reins of the sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, in 2004.\n\nHe\u2019s the longest-serving managing director of the fund, which is owned by the Finance Ministry, making him well acquainted with the inner workings of government.\n\nHe oversaw the fund\u2019s international expansion and led investments in healthcare, technology and creative industries while formulating deals to invest in an assortment of local companies.\n\nFrom mid-2004 through 2017, it notched average annual compound gains of 9.6%, trailing the 10% return of the KLCI Index.\n\nHe was regarded as part of then-premier Najib\u2019s inner circle, advising him on the economy and capital markets. After Najib and Umno\u2019s historic defeat in GE14, Azman and the Khazanah board stepped down.\n\nThey had come under scrutiny by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister a second time and said the fund invested in too many companies.\n\nTan Sri Nazir Razak, 56\n\nNazir was born into political royalty as the son of the Malaysia\u2019s second premier and the younger brother of Najib. He joined CIMB in the late 1980s and oversaw its rapid expansion, including a hostile takeover of Southern Bank.\n\nAfter stepping down as CIMB CEO in 2014, but keeping the chairman role, Nazir became increasingly critical of the government\u2019s handling of 1MDB and its impact on Malaysia.\n\nThe country needs to \"fix our moral compass and deal with our structural problems,\u201d he said in 2016. Shortly after, he took a leave of absence while CIMB probed a US$7mil transfer to his personal bank account from Najib, which had surfaced as part of the scandal.\n\nHe was cleared and remained chairman until 2018.\n\nNazir has said he wants to broaden policies that now favour the Malays to also benefit ethnic groups in the lower-income bracket.\n\nHe\u2019s in the mix as many in corporate Malaysia regard him as a known entity who understands what\u2019s needed to restart the economy.\n\nAnthony Loke, 45\n\nLoke was widely liked by Malaysians across the political spectrum when he was transport minister under Dr Mahathir\u2019s short-lived administration from 2018.\n\nThat\u2019s because he\u2019s played a big role in renegotiating costly infrastructure contracts struck under Najib\u2019s government and making public transport more efficient.\n\nHolding the powerful secretary-general role in the DAP - the party with the most seats in Pakatan Harapan - Loke is well positioned to get a key Cabinet role.\n\nHowever the centre-left party, which drew the support of Chinese and Indian voters, is likely to defer Cabinet positions to Malay lawmakers to ensure the coalition remains stable.\n\nDatuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, 75\n\nThe newly-appointed Prime Minister told reporters last week that he\u2019s not considering taking the role, at least at the moment. But such decisions can change and after all, Anwar\u2019s predecessors Najib and Dr Mahathir both took charge of state finances toward the end of their reigns.\n\nAnwar was finance minister in Dr Mahathir\u2019s cabinet for seven years and was fired at the height of the 1998 financial crisis after a falling out with his boss over the economy, in particular foreign exchange and capital controls.\n\nDr Mahathir wanted a low interest rate environment with more spending while Anwar advocated a tighter monetary policy with austerity measures. - Bloomberg",

In addition to this, they want a local in the role of FT minister.\n\nNOW that the winners of the 15th General Election have been announced, it is time for newly-elected representatives to deliver on their campaign manifesto.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur, the over one million registered voters are keen to ensure their MPs remember their promises and fulfil them.\n\nThe 14-day campaign period saw 52 candidates vying for 11 seats in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur encompasses 11 parliamentary constituencies.\n\nWith several new faces voted in and eight incumbents returning in their constituencies, now is the time to take stock and see that they deliver on their pledges.\n\nStarMetro spoke to city folk on some of the expectations that they have of their newly elected MPs for the next five years.\n\n> An FT minister from Kuala Lumpur\n\nChief among their wants is for a local to head the Federal Territories Ministry.\n\n\u201cA local Federal Territories Minister will have a better understanding and can appreciate the issues that are affecting us,\u201d said Brickfields Rukun Tetangga chairman SKK Naidu, 56.\n\n\u201cOnly if you live in Kuala Lumpur and have experienced the traffic congestion, pollution, flash floods and over-development, can you know what it is like living in this city,\u201d he opined.\n\nLawrence Yap, a Bukit Jalil resident, agreed and said they have had ministers who did not know the matters affecting the people.\n\nYap hopes for a minister who has first-hand experience of those issues.\n\nDBKL\u2019s enforcement unit is urged to improve its efficiency, especially in dealing with traders occupying public spaces and pedestrian walkways like this one along Jalan Jalil Perkasa 1 in Bukit Jalil. \u2014 Filepic\n\n\u201cAllowing roadside stalls to operate on public walkways and bus stops that caused congestion and allowing mobile stalls to obstruct walkways with chairs and tables is against DBKL by-laws.\n\n\u201cThis blatant abuse of rules and regulations must end,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe last three Federal Territories ministers \u2013 Khalid Abdul Samad, Tan Sri Annuar Musa and Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim \u2013 were not from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nKhalid was the Shah Alam MP, Annuar was the MP of Ketereh in Kelantan, while Shahidan was Arau MP (Perlis).\n\n> Listen to people\u2019s views\n\nKuala Lumpur folk are very clear on the need for accountability and good governance by their elected representatives.\n\n\u201cWe want to participate in the decision-making process,\u2019\u2019 said long-time resident Dr Christopher Nicholas, 65.\n\n\u201cTo be accountable, they need to be open and transparent. We want to see a more open and accountable Federal Territories Ministry and Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL),\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK TO ENLARGE\n\n\u201cIf DBKL is going to build bridges in my neighbourhood or approve high-rises in my backyard, at least tell us first and give us all the facts and figures. They must share the information,\u201d he added.\n\nM. Viknendran, 53, wants his MP to push for more public engagement between the residents and the local authority before carrying out any project.\n\n\u201cThe participation of citizens in the decision-making process must be the goal,\u201d added the Bangsar resident.\n\n> More efficient government agencies\n\nMarzuki Ahmad, from Bandar Tasik Selatan in Cheras, wants to see better service from agencies like DBKL, SWCorp, the Road Transport Department and the Drainage and Irrigation Department.\n\n\u201cThere must be follow-up action for each complaint made, especially from DBKL\u2019s enforcement unit. We want to see their officers carrying out enforcement without fear,\u201d he said.\n\nA resident of Taman Titiwangsa, who requested to be identified only as Patma, wants DBKL to stop allowing petty traders to occupy parking lots in his area.\n\nViknendran says citizen participation in the decision-making process must be the goal.\n\n\u201cWe pay taxes for a clean and peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cHaving to deal with congestion and rubbish has affected our peace of mind and quality of life.\n\n\u201cIt is time we get a minister and a mayor who are willing to make hard decisions and not be swayed by politics,\u201d Patma added.\n\n> Stop politicking, start working\n\nDozens of people interviewed by StarMetro also want their MPs to stop playing politics and interfering with the work of government agencies.\n\n\u201cLawmakers should not take sides in any matter and must remain neutral in any community dispute,\u201d said Mokhtar Sudin from Wangsa Maju.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t support people who break the law. If a law is broken, then let the authorities take action,\u201d he said, referring to the illegal stalls that have cropped up in his neighbourhood.\n\nNaidu wants an elected representative from Kuala Lumpur to head the FT Ministry.\n\n\u201cLikewise, we want to see less political interference in DBKL by the Federal Territories Minister,\u201d said CS Tan, 62, from Taman United in Jalan Kelang Lama.\n\n\u201cLeave issues like liquor licence and entertainment licence to the local authorities,\u201d he said.\n\n> KL needs an elected mayor\n\nThe Selamatkan Kuala Lumpur (SKL) Movement is advocating sustainable growth and development to protect the city and its future.\n\nTo this end, the movement believes it is time that the residents are allowed to elect their mayor.\n\n\u201cIt is time to democratise DBKL, by having an elected mayor, to ensure effective community participation and freeze any amendments to the Kuala Lumpur City Plan 2020,\u201d said SKL chairman Datuk M. Ali.\n\n\u201cMy message to our elected officials and the Kuala Lumpur mayor is simple -- there must be no decision without engagement with the community.\n\n\u201cThe mayor, DBKL and the new MPs must engage and have more town halls with residents. Just walk the talk,\u2019\u2019 said Ali.\n\nWong says an elected mayor will work harder for the people.\n\nSKL\u2019s objective is to work in partnership with the authorities to make Kuala Lumpur an environmentally sustainable and liveable city for the benefit of all residents and future generations.\n\nIt hopes to do this by ensuring that residents\u2019 views and voices are heard and taken into consideration in the development and growth of the city.\n\nTaman Desa Residents Association chairman Wong Chan Choy, 61, is also pushing for an elected mayor for Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\u201cAn elected mayor will work harder for the people as they are not bound to any political master.\n\n\u201cFurthermore you have better accountability arising from direct election,\u201d said Wong.\n\nOn polling day, Pakatan Harapan won 10 parliamentary seats in Kuala Lumpur, with Barisan Nasional taking one.\n\nDAP won five seats \u2013 Bukit Bintang, Cheras, Seputeh, Segambut and Kepong while PKR won Lembah Pantai, Wangsa Maju, Bandar Tun Razak, Setiawangsa and Batu.\n\nDatuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who was the former Pandan MP, won the Bandar Tun Razak seat while newcomer Zahir Hassan won in Wangsa Maju.\n\nFormer Titiwangsa MP Datuk Seri Johari Ghani from Barisan Nasional managed to wrest back the seat with a 4,623 majority vote, the lowest in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nA total of 1,111,693 people in Kuala Lumpur voted in GE15.",
        "KUALA LUMPUR: Ten Independent candidates are contesting in five of the 11 constituencies in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nOr to put it another way, 52 candidates are fighting for 11 parliamentary seats, none of which will be seeing any straight fight like the old days.\n\nWhile political observers opined that most Independent candidates are likely to lose their deposits, their participation in the electoral process is crucial as they bring a fresh perspective to the fight which is usually dominated by familiar faces.\n\n\u201cSome are high-calibre candidates with strong manifesto, and they are sending out clear messages to voters,\u2019\u2019 said Dr Azmi Hasan, a senior fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.\n\n\u201cKuala Lumpur voters are educated and they want to hear more than just the average promises from candidates about unclogging drains or patching potholes. They are looking at the big picture, sustainable living, flood prevention, climate change \u2013 long-term plans.\u201d\n\nAnother political observer said he did not expect any Independent candidate to win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Independents are putting up a fight, but I doubt that anyone would win. It\u2019s going to be very hard even for Tian Chua. But I do hope that they don\u2019t lose their deposits,\u201d he added.\n\nTian Chua, whose real name is Chua Tian Chang, is a former Batu MP who is contesting as an Independent in his former seat, which is seeing a 10-cornered fight.\n\nHe will face off with incumbent P. Prabakaran from PKR, the person he endorsed in the last election, as well as lawyer-cum-activist Siti Kassim. Another colourful name in the mix is Nur Fathiah Syazwana@Cleo while Too Gao Lan is also an Independent there.\n\nSeputeh is also seeing an interesting mix of candidates, with one such person being Lee Wai Hong, 42.\n\n\u201cI am not stupid. I am just idealistic,\u2019\u2019 Lee said, referring to his decision to contest in a DAP stronghold against Teresa Kok.\n\n\u201cI want to make an impact and push for ways to prevent our democracy from being hijacked again,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to the Sheraton Move.\n\nLee, the former Youth Chief of the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly, wants to push for a Recall Elections Act, which enables \u201cdefectors\u201d to be removed through the calling of a by-election.\n\n\u201cIf I can retain my (electoral) deposit, I will donate it to SJK(C) Yoke Nam in Taman OUG,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment is Ravee Suntheralingam, 60, who is contesting in Wangsa Maju.\n\nRavee, who was previously with PKR, and had worked to put two Wangsa Maju MPs in Parliament, is pushing for urban poverty eradication, clean governance and proper procurement procedures.\n\n\u201cI left PKR due to internal tussles,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWhile Ravee and Lee are open about their goals, another Independent in Seputeh has remained somewhat of a mystery, and only interacts with the media via WhatsApp, although she did address a ceramah a few days ago.\n\nLian Choy Ling is registered under the name \u201cChoy San Yeh\u201d, which is Cantonese for God of Fortune. Lian said she is contesting because \u201cshe had no candidate to vote for\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany people around me are angry with Pakatan Harapan, so they choose not to vote. I have come across people who expressed feelings of anger, of being betrayed, and disappointment,\u201c she said.\n\nHowever, analysts think that the clash between pure idealism and established ideology during a general election usually results in a one-sided outcome.\n\nNational Professors Council senior fellow Dr Jeniri Amir described Independents going against huge political parties akin to a mouse deer between two elephants.\n\n\u201cThey are fighting uphill battles,\u2019\u2019 he said. They may have reasons for doing so, but they don\u2019t stand a chance,\u2019\u2019 Jeniri added.\n\nWhile Batu has been described as a winnable seat for an Independent - Prabakaran did it in 2018 before joining PKR - Azmi feels PKR will most likely retain Batu.\n\n\u201cIn Malaysia, politics is never about a candidate, no matter how good he or she is. It\u2019s always been about toeing the party line,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAnother seat to watch is Titiwangsa which will see a four-way tussle between PKR, Barisan, Perikatan Nasional and Pejuang.\n\nAll eyes are on Barisan\u2019s former MP and Finance Minister II, Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani, who will be facing former Federal Territories Minister and Shah Alam incumbent Khalid Samad from Amanah, who is contesting under the PKR ticket, as well as in Bandar Tun Razak, where PKR\u2019s Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail will go against Barisan\u2019s Datuk Chew Yin Keen, and incumbent Datuk Kamarudin Jaafar from Bersatu.\n\nThe other independents in KL are Yee Poh Ping (Kepong) and Maj Meor Rosli and Stanley Lim Yen Tiong, both in Setiawangsa.",
        "KUCHING: Development Bank of Sarawak (DBOS) will partner with other financial institutions on business opportunities such as club deal syndication loans, according to its chairman Tan Sri Mohamad Morshidi Abdul Ghani.\n\nHe said the bank, which currently focuses on financing strategic projects for the transformation of Sarawak, will actively identify opportunities to provide green finance to ventures that embed environmental, social and governance (ESG) into their business practices.\n\n\u201cDBOS will leverage digitalisation applications to create a smart-banking system, operations and service delivery.\n\n\u201cIt also plans to embark on a syariah-compliant banking business as well as charting its initiative on ESG in line with Sarawak\u2019s Post Covid-19 Development Strategy 2030 (PCDS 2030) toward inclusivity, sustainability and environment,\u201d he said at the bank\u2019s 5th anniversary dinner.\n\nMohamad Morshidi said DBOS had approved total loans of RM15.27bil, with a progressive drawdown of RM8.93bil since its establishment.\n\nThe bank\u2019s total assets have grown to RM9.47bil, with retained earnings of about RM130.5mil as of October 2022. DBOS was launched in 2017 with a paid-up capital of RM500mil from Sarawak\u2019s reserve funds.\n\nSarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg, who graced the anniversary dinner, said being a state-owned development financial institution, DBOS was mandated to fund strategic infrastructure projects that would transform the socio-economic well-being of Sarawakians.\n\nHe said these projects include the Sarawak Water Supply Grid programme, Sarawak Second Trunk Road and Sarawak Coastal Road and rural electrification scheme.\n\nAlso to be financed are other projects planned and implemented under agencies such as Integrated Regional Samarahan Development Agency and projects in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy region \u2013 the Upper Rajang Development Agency, Highland Development Agency and the Northern Regional Development Agency.\n\nThe development bank was asked to offer its financing facilities and services to the newly established Greater Kuching Coordinated Development Authority and Betong Integrated Development Agency.\n\nDBOS has thus far facilitated and provided the state with the fiscal flexibility in strategising its development programmes whereby alternative sources of funding will ensure funds are readily available to keep the development momentum continuing without the uncertainties of scrambling to source funding from internally or from the federal government, nor be dependent on the public market.\n\nSince its inception, total approved credit facilities for the state\u2019s strategic projects stood at over RM15bil covering projects throughout Sarawak and encompassing several key mandated sectors. \u2014 By JACK WONG",

        "KUALA LUMPUR: Unlike most other constituencies which have a higher ratio of residential areas compared to commercial, Bukit Bintang\u2019s composition is the reverse.\n\nBukit Bintang is ultra-urban and a first world constituency. The area is known as the golden triangle for shopping and entertainment, with a high concentration of malls and premium office towers.\n\nWhile the Bukit Bintang parliamentary constituency has almost 80,000 voters, the high density of commercial buildings in the area means that a majority of its voters no longer reside in the area.\n\n\u201cMost Bukit Bintang voters are living all over the Klang Valley, such as Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Cheras or Ampang. Those who stay here are mostly foreigners,\u201d said Tan Teik Peng, MCA\u2019s candidate for Bukit Bintang.\n\nAccording to Tan, the luxury condominiums are mostly occupied by expatriates and Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) participants, while affordable housing has been rented out to migrant workers.\n\n\u201cOf course, we understand that locals find it more economical to live outside KL, while the city needs the support of foreign workers to keep it running,\u201d said the financial planner who holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in micro electronics.\n\nThis unique dynamic means that politicians have to seek creative ways to campaign. A ceramah will not be effective in reaching out to the voters since they are not in Bukit Bintang.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for us to find the voters. As such, we have to focus more on digital campaigns. Social media will be the best way to connect with them,\u201d said Tan, who is Federal Territory MCA Youth chief.\n\nTo convince this \u201cabsent\u201d electorate, national issues take precedence over local matters, such as reversing the brain drain and ensuring Kuala Lumpur remains appealing and attractive to the young generation, Tan said.\n\n\u201cBukit Bintang is very developed. How can we develop it further? How can Bukit Bintang help the youth progress in their career? These are some issues we need to consider.\n\n\u201cWe can put forth a digitalisation policy to attract back our IT talent. Also, make Bukit Bintang a hub for e-sports \u2013 not just for gamers, but also for developers,\u201d he said.\n\nTan, the son of former senator Datuk Tan Son Lee, also wants to enhance the heritage and historical elements of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\u201cWe must promote local culture and not just focus on commercial development.\n\n\u201cPetaling Street, for example, has many historical landmarks and is home to many clan associations. We can infuse the use of technology to boost tourism in KL.\n\n\u201cThis could be as simple as placing QR codes at tourist attractions, and upon scanning, one will receive suggestions of other nearby attractions. It becomes a form of guided tour,\u201d he said.\n\nIn GE15, Tan will be challenging DAP treasurer Fong Kui Lun (Pakatan Harapan) who has been Bukit Bintang\u2019s MP for the past five terms.\n\nAt 76, Fong is DAP\u2019s oldest candidate in the polls, while Tan, 42, is making his electoral debut.\n\n\u201cWe need young blood to refresh Bukit Bintang,\u201d said Jalan Alor Traders and Hawkers Association secretary Simon Ang.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky Bukit Bintang is a developed constituency, and we must now take it to the next level.\u201d\n\nThe demographics of Bukit Bintang\u2019s electorate makes the contest more exciting, with only 25.3% of voters under the age of 40, compared to the national average of 47%.\n\nThe lowering of the minimum age to 18 for voters only saw an injection of 2.6% new voters aged between 18 and 21, while the national average is 6.3%.\n\nIn contrast, voters aged 60 and above make up 39.5% of Bukit Bintang, almost double the national average of 20.1%.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, it will be tough.

However, if the public complies with the health measures, we can control and manage the rise (in infections),\u201d said Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\n\nFor comparison, there were less than 2,000 cases a day just last month.

They also called for the Election Commission to announce guidelines for voters down with Covid-19.\n\nMalaysian Medical Association president Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai said cases could rise further if more people do not take precautions, especially when attending crowded events.\n\n\u201cAs we have advised before, the use of face masks is highly recommended at this time when many political gatherings are being held nationwide,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he noted that though a spike in cases is almost certain, it is difficult to predict the rate of increase as there is freedom of movement and the many political gatherings being held nationwide.\n\n\u201cFrom our observation, there is an increase in people wearing face masks around town and there is good compliance in places where wearing facemasks are mandatory like on public transportation and in hospitals. But disappointingly, many politicians have not been wearing face masks when meeting the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur advice is to wear face masks when attending any political event. While a younger person may easily recover from Covid-19, there is always the risk of the virus being spread to someone who may be at high risk of getting severe symptoms, hospitalisation and even death. We have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable,\u201d he added.\n\nUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia health economics, hospital and health management Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh expects hospitalisation in Categories 3 to 5 to increase by 20% and cases to trend in the 4,000 range as a result of the Nov 5 nomination day and the campaign period which started on the same day.\n\nShe said compliance to precautionary measures was still less than satisfactory with people moving around without a face mask, and congregating with a lack of physical distancing.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to have forgotten that Covid-19 is still around,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Sharifa proposed that voting centres be separated for positive cases, adding that these venues must also have good ventilation and proper spacing.\n\nShe also suggested that a new mechanism, such as an e-voting system, be developed especially for those who are warded at hospitals.\n\nVoters and staff at polling booths should be fully vaccinated and boosted, she added.\n\nMedical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah is expecting cases to hit beyond the 5,000-6,000 range.\n\n\u201cHardly any SOP is being followed, as we see ceramah and campaigning taking place,\u201d he said.\n\nHe advised political parties, candidates and voters to not assume that the pandemic is over, especially in view of the new XBB sub-variant.\n\nIf possible, he said political parties should opt for alternatives such as online campaigning instead of physical ceramah. As for physical ceramah, he said it has to be held at open areas such as a field and seats should also be spread out.\n\nPublic health advocate and Volunteers For Community Engagement and Empowerment for Covid-19 chairman Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said the number of cases could trend in the 4,000-5,000 range in the next two to three weeks due to the numerous gatherings across the country.\n\nHe advised those on the ground to continue taking precautionary measures, get booster shots and avoid public events if they are unwell.",

The town planning needs to be better, and I will leverage on my technical background to assist on this,\u201d says Chong who holds a degree in civil engineering.\n\nCheras has transformed into an ultra-urban township \u2013 from its early days in the 1900s as a flourishing hub for rubber plantations and tin mines.\n\nToday, it is a densely populated area due to its close proximity to the Kuala Lumpur city centre, as well as connectivity via major highways such as the East-West Link Expressway, Middle Ring Road 2, Kajang SILK Highway, Cheras-Kajang Expressway, and the upcoming East Klang Valley Expressway.\n\n\u201cDemand for properties in Cheras will continue to rise, and this will push prices up.\n\n\u201cHowever, the reality is that not everyone can afford properties at market value. That is the harsh truth of urban living.\n\n\u201cI will push for more affordable housing for the people, especially first-time home owners.\n\n\u201cThe Government can\u2019t do this alone; it will need cooperation with private developers, similar to the mechanics of the PR1MA programme,\u201d says Chong who has been special functions officer to Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong since 2013.\n\nHe also highlights the need to address the issue of stateless children unable to attain citizenship as one of their parents is not Malaysian, or because their parents are not married to each other.\n\n\u201cThe Home Minister has the discretion to grant citizenship on a case-by-case basis. But we should have clear and transparent criteria rather than it being dictated by the minister\u2019s discretionary powers,\u201d he says.\n\nOn a similar note, Chong says there is a need to amend the Federal Constitution to grant automatic citizenship to the child of a Malaysian woman married to a foreigner. At present, citizenship is only granted automatically to the child of a Malaysian man.\n\n\u201cBoth men and women must be seen as equal,\u201d he says.\n\nThe fight for the Cheras parliamentary seat will also involve Ruby Chin Yoke Kheng (Bersatu/Perikatan Nasional).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a change,\u201d says James Tan, 35, an entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cSomeone to inject new ideas and perspective, not just for Cheras, but also in Parliament,\u201d he says.\n\nHelping Ah Long victims is part of Low\u2019s duties as Perak MCA Public Service and Complaints Bureau chief.\n\nIn Ipoh, Barisan candidate Low Guo Nan finds himself in a similar situation.\n\nThe 39-year-old counsellor has a mammoth task to unseat DAP vice-chairman M.

With the right business and career opportunities, we can retain Ipoh\u2019s talent,\u201d says Low.\n\nIn his role as Perak MCA Public Service and Complaints Bureau chief, Low has seen his fair share of people getting scammed.\n\n\u201cThis is something I want to raise in Parliament,\u201d he says, and that he will push for policy to tackle the scourge.\n\nHe finds the Malaysian process of tackling scammers as being too reactive, with the police requiring victims to first lodge reports.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too late as they would already have been scammed,\u201d says Low.\n\n\u201cSingapore and China are developing ways to be more proactive, such as detecting unusual financial activities. There is also multi-agency collaboration to freeze the scammers\u2019 bank accounts immediately,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn Malaysia, the police can investigate but the power to block a scammer\u2019s account lies with Bank Negara.

Why are we being treated like illegal hawkers?\n\n\u201cThe notice came without any prior warning and now they want to evict us immediately.\u201d\n\nAccording to the notice, the hawkers had violated Section 425 (1) of the National Land Code by occupying the road reserve land.\n\nThey were also told to demolish their structures and leave, failing which they risk a fine of RM500,000 or a jail term not exceeding five years.\n\nMixed rice stall operator Chew Kok Wai, 42 said he had been trading at the spot for 30 years and he holds a valid licence.\n\n\u201cThe eviction notice is uncalled for,\u201d he said, adding that the disappointed hawkers immediately sought the assistance of incumbent Cheras MP Tan Kok Wai.\n\nTan said he would send a letter of appeal to PTGWP, requesting that the notice be withdrawn.\n\n\u201cThe fact that DBKL had issued the hawkers trading licences is evident that the area is suitable for them to operate in.\n\n\u201cThe reason given by PTGWP is unfair as there are more than 100 spots in Kuala Lumpur where traders occupy government or road reserve land. Does that mean they all will be given an eviction notice too?\u201d\n\nHe said that he enquired about the matter with PTGWP\u2019s Enforcement Department but was told they did not know about the eviction notice.\n\n\u201cThe department also could not tell me if they had received any complaints about the hawkers.\n\n\u201cI hope they will reconsider the eviction notice,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted by StarMetro, PTGWP director Datuk Muhammad Yasih Yahya said the eviction notice was issued following investigations that the traders had erected permanent structures on government land.\n\n\u201cThese caused disturbance, from the safety and cleanliness aspects.\n\n\u201cEnforcement taken is in accordance with Section 425 (1) of the National Land Code.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted 37 continuous joint operations in Kuala Lumpur against those who encroach on government land,\u201d he added.",

        "PETALING JAYA: There was much speculation after several big names were dropped from PKR\u2019s candidate list, with analysts saying this could be due to factions within the party.\n\nHowever, Tian Chua has denied that incumbent MPs like R. Sivarasa and Maria Chin Abdullah were dropped because they were pro-Azmin.\n\nBut Universiti Sains Malaysia\u2019s political science expert Prof Dr Sivamurugan Pandian said it was now time for PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to focus on his loyalists rather than his former deputy Datuk Seri Azmin Ali.\n\n\u201cThis is to make sure PKR moves beyond the March 2020 saga,\u201d he said, adding, the fight between Selangor Mentri Besar Amirudin Shari and former mentri besar Azmin (for the Gombak seat) needs to be closely watched.\n\n\u201cBoth have their loyalists, and I think voter turnout will determine the outcome, which will be determined by the party they represent and their personalities.\n\n\u201cIn terms of how this will impact the elections, it depends on how Azmin\u2019s loyalists see the elections \u2013 focus on personality or the party,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical think tank Ilham Center\u2019s executive director Hisomuddin Bakar said a few factors could be why incumbents such as Maria and Sivarasa were dropped.\n\n\u201cMaria is known as a civil society activist as she was from Bersih. She was chosen as a PKR candidate and won. But, throughout her tenure as a lawmaker, she seemed unable to assimilate into PKR\u2019s culture. This is why she was dropped,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Sivarasa, on the other hand, \u201cdid not shine\u201d after the departure of a few former PKR MPs, including Azmin.\n\n\u201cSivarasa did get the brunt of some party members who saw him as being aligned to the Azmin camp,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Zaireeni Azmi, University Sains Malaysia senior lecturer for Research on Women and Gender, said PKR could have its factions between those who supported Azmin and those who didn\u2019t.\n\nAs such, she said it was important for Anwar to take precautionary measures in naming the party\u2019s candidates to ensure another \u201cSheraton move\u201d would not occur among the elected representatives.\n\n\u201cAnwar is looking at the future for the next best prospective leaders should Pakatan Harapan form a government again,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that not fielding certain candidates might cause a rift among party members, creating a backlash and people leaving the party.\n\nTian Chua said he had no issue with Anwar\u2019s remarks that older candidates must give way to younger candidates, but added Azmin\u2019s allies had left the party with him.\n\n\u201cI am not pro-Azmin. If I were, I would have gone with him already. So, the rest of them are not pro-Azmin. Maria is not pro-Azmin, she is a Bersih person. Lee has nothing to do with being pro- Azmin,\u201d he said.\n\nTian Chua stated that whether it was possible to justify why they were dropped was a separate issue.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with Azmin. I have always been closer to Anwar.

        "Dining in the sky was once associated with mushy food or being served something that looked (and tasted) inedible. But now airlines \u2013 tired of being a punch line, no doubt \u2013 have upped their culinary game.\n\nThese days, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear of partnerships between carriers and celebrity chefs or gourmet restaurateurs.\n\nMany of these culinary big names often have huge followings, bringing with them not only taste, but also glamour, to the airline.\n\nCloser to home, Malaysian celebrity chef Datuk Redzuawan Ismail \u2013 popularly known as Chef Wan \u2013 has created a commemorative menu with Qatar Airways.\n\nTo Chef Wan, the partnership gave him an opportunity to showcase uniquely Malaysian culinary heritage to a global audience.\n\n\u201cOur food has such history and diversity from different parts of the world, especially Asia, and it\u2019s something that we are able to showcase to the whole world,\u201d he said during the launch of the menu at his restaurant in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe banana fritter is given a contemporary spin by the chef. \u2014 CHESTER CHIN/The StarChef Wan drew on his Peranakan heritage to create some of the dishes on the menu. Since Peranakan cuisine requires a lot of finesse to prepare and serve, this translates to food with exacting standards.\n\n\u201cFrom the early years of my culinary experience (learning) from my grandmother, I realised how important it was to pay attention to detail and the quality of the food,\u201d he said, adding that much effort went into curating a quality menu for the airline.\n\nThe main course that will be served onboard include ayam percik with lemon rice pilaf, charcoal-grilled fish fillet with spicy Portuguese sauce and lamb kuzi with Terengganu-style rice.\n\nThe Malaysian-insired meals, according to Qatar Airways, will give passengers a taste of Malaysia\u2019s illustrious food heritage.\n\nFor certain, airline food has improved in leaps and bounds since its mushy days. Many of these chefs would need to consider the science behind food tasting differently at a high altitude.\n\nBeing at a high altitude, according to experts, has a very real effect on our sense of smell and taste.\n\nIn a pressurised cabin, our blood oxygen levels are lowered. This reduces the ability of our olfactory receptors. Adding to that is the constantly circulating, dry air of the plane cabin that directly affects the nose.\n\nThe aforementioned certainly lends a better appreciation for food that is created for aeroplane passengers.\n\nWe track down some other exciting past and present partnerships between airlines and celebrated chefs.\n\nMost of these specially curated menus are only available for First Class and Business Class passengers.\n\nBut there are also some collaborations that extend to the menu on Economy Class.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSingapore\u2019s national carrier roped in not one, not two, but seven world-renowned chefs to curate its in-flight food menu. Dubbed the International Culinary Panel, these chefs are constantly creating new dishes for passengers. Some of the names of its roster today include Australian celebrity chef Matthew Moran, Michelin-starred restaurateur Carlo Cracco and kaiseki master Yoshihiro Murata.\n\nAll Nippon Airways\n\nLike Singapore Airlines, All Nippon Airways (ANA) also has a team of internationally renowned chefs. Collectively referred to as \u201cThe Connoisseurs\u201d, the team\u2019s speciality lies in a range of cuisine \u2013 from Japanese to French and fusion. Some names on its current roster are Toru Okuda, Yoshihiro Takahashi, Ryuta Iizuka and Hideki Takayama.\n\nAir France\n\nBeing the flag carrier of the culinary capital of the world, Air France has roped in many celebrated French chefs over the years. Anne-Sophie Pic, Francois Adamski, Guy Martin and Michel Roth are among some of the big names that design the meals onboard the airline. These signature dishes are occasionally renewed to give passengers a taste of more wonderful culinary creations.\n\nQantas\n\nAustralian celebrity chef Neil Perry and Qantas have partnered up since 1997, making it the longest partnership of its kind. As the chef behind the revered Rockpool restaurants in many major Australian cities, Perry has brought to the airline many innovative dishes over the years. His culinary creations are designed around seasonality and artisanal producers.",

        "KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim promised a unity government to stabilise the country and now he needs to find a finance minister who can steer the economy and help him hold onto power.\n\nThe 10th Prime Minister's pick must present a budget next month that can shield Malaysia\u2019s fragile recovery amid concerns of a global slowdown next year.\n\nInflation is elevated and the still-weak currency has made living costs untenable for many low and middle-income households.\n\nThe job, which involves overseeing big projects to boost the economy and setting strategy for Malaysia\u2019s state investment funds, is widely seen as a training ground for future prime ministers.\n\nPast leaders at times have appointed loyal technocrats or simply taken on the finance portfolio themselves.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to pick a political nobody, \"except in the case where the prime minister wants to stay in charge,\u201d said Woo Wing Thye, professor emeritus at University of California at Davis who focuses on East Asian economies.\n\n\"The finance minister\u2019s job is to identify good projects and have the political standing to be able to push what he thinks to be the right economic stance for the government,\u201d he added.\n\nAnwar has numerous candidates to consider given he heads a coalition made up of at least four political groups. Here\u2019s a look at the top candidates:\n\nDatuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, 66\n\nMohamad is the deputy president of Umno, the linchpin of Barisan Nasional that joined Anwar\u2019s government last week.\n\nHe had a 25-year career in banking and the corporate sector before being elected to public office in 2004.\n\nHe also served as Mentri Besar of Negri Sembilan, where he\u2019s credited with reducing the region\u2019s debt and boosting economic growth.\u201d\n\nMohamad was the election director for the UMNO-led coalition and actively pushed then-premier Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to call for snap elections so it could capitalise on a string of local polls victories.\n\nThe coalition lost significant ground and Mohamad was initially reluctant to join Anwar\u2019s government.\n\nSeveral Barisan Nasional lawmakers have publicly said he should be one of Anwar\u2019s two deputy prime ministers.\n\nDatuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani, 58\n\nA trained accountant, Johari is best known for running fast-food franchise KFC Holdings in the 1990s.\n\nHe\u2019s a long-time Umno member and came to the forefront when he won the Titiwangsa parliamentary seat in 2013.\n\nThree years later, then-premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak named him second finance minister as part of a Cabinet reshuffle that rewarded party loyalists.\n\nEven though his boss held primary control over federal finances, it was Johari who spoke publicly about the escalating crisis of 1MDB and its billions of dollars of debt. He\u2019s helped buy over Umno\u2019s stake in companies like KUB Malaysia in 2019 to help the party stay afloat after some of its bank accounts were frozen in relation to the 1MDB scandal.\n\nJohari lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 but won it back in the 15th General Election (GE15) as he was seen by the majority Malay voters in the district as a capable administrator.\n\nRafizi Ramli, 45\n\nRafizi was swept up in the \"reformasi\" movement protesting Anwar\u2019s sacking as deputy prime minister in 1998. He worked as an accountant with state oil and gas producer Petronas for about six years before quitting to focus on politics with Anwar and his party, PKR.\n\nHe was elected to Parliament in 2013 and focused on exposing corruption related to Najib and his government, including 1MDB.\n\nHis revelations helped fuel public anger against Umno and led to its historic defeat in GE14 in 2018, though he was ineligible to defend his seat as he was appealing a jail sentence for leaking contents of a 1MDB audit report. He was acquitted in 2019.\n\nRafizi returned to the political fray earlier this year. His team swept most of the positions in PKR and he now holds its powerful deputy president position.\n\nTan Sri Azman Mokhtar, 61\n\nAzman Mokhtar worked at Malaysia\u2019s electric utility and cycled through a series of finance jobs before taking the reins of the sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, in 2004.\n\nHe\u2019s the longest-serving managing director of the fund, which is owned by the Finance Ministry, making him well acquainted with the inner workings of government.\n\nHe oversaw the fund\u2019s international expansion and led investments in healthcare, technology and creative industries while formulating deals to invest in an assortment of local companies.\n\nFrom mid-2004 through 2017, it notched average annual compound gains of 9.6%, trailing the 10% return of the KLCI Index.\n\nHe was regarded as part of then-premier Najib\u2019s inner circle, advising him on the economy and capital markets. After Najib and Umno\u2019s historic defeat in GE14, Azman and the Khazanah board stepped down.\n\nThey had come under scrutiny by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister a second time and said the fund invested in too many companies.\n\nTan Sri Nazir Razak, 56\n\nNazir was born into political royalty as the son of the Malaysia\u2019s second premier and the younger brother of Najib. He joined CIMB in the late 1980s and oversaw its rapid expansion, including a hostile takeover of Southern Bank.\n\nAfter stepping down as CIMB CEO in 2014, but keeping the chairman role, Nazir became increasingly critical of the government\u2019s handling of 1MDB and its impact on Malaysia.\n\nThe country needs to \"fix our moral compass and deal with our structural problems,\u201d he said in 2016. Shortly after, he took a leave of absence while CIMB probed a US$7mil transfer to his personal bank account from Najib, which had surfaced as part of the scandal.\n\nHe was cleared and remained chairman until 2018.\n\nNazir has said he wants to broaden policies that now favour the Malays to also benefit ethnic groups in the lower-income bracket.\n\nHe\u2019s in the mix as many in corporate Malaysia regard him as a known entity who understands what\u2019s needed to restart the economy.\n\nAnthony Loke, 45\n\nLoke was widely liked by Malaysians across the political spectrum when he was transport minister under Dr Mahathir\u2019s short-lived administration from 2018.\n\nThat\u2019s because he\u2019s played a big role in renegotiating costly infrastructure contracts struck under Najib\u2019s government and making public transport more efficient.\n\nHolding the powerful secretary-general role in the DAP - the party with the most seats in Pakatan Harapan - Loke is well positioned to get a key Cabinet role.\n\nHowever the centre-left party, which drew the support of Chinese and Indian voters, is likely to defer Cabinet positions to Malay lawmakers to ensure the coalition remains stable.\n\nDatuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, 75\n\nThe newly-appointed Prime Minister told reporters last week that he\u2019s not considering taking the role, at least at the moment. But such decisions can change and after all, Anwar\u2019s predecessors Najib and Dr Mahathir both took charge of state finances toward the end of their reigns.\n\nAnwar was finance minister in Dr Mahathir\u2019s cabinet for seven years and was fired at the height of the 1998 financial crisis after a falling out with his boss over the economy, in particular foreign exchange and capital controls.\n\nDr Mahathir wanted a low interest rate environment with more spending while Anwar advocated a tighter monetary policy with austerity measures. - Bloomberg",

It has been going on for so long and the people of Sabah want a concrete way forward.\n\n\"At this current level of negotiation, I don\u2019t think it leads to the expected understanding and agreement.\n\n\"Maybe we need a new agreement.

The transition to the future economy in various basic sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism and industry must be mainstreamed,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Sabah was a very important state in the effort to form a stable BN government, and without Sabah, Barisan would face difficulties in getting the required majority.\n\n\"Without seats from Sabah, instability will continue to be the Malaysian political landscape,\" he said. - Bernama",
        "A controversial appointment almost eclipses Anwar\u2019s maiden Cabinet but it is generally a line-up of younger and fresher faces.\n\nTHE most asked question in the last one week has finally been answered.\n\nAnd the answer is: Yes, Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is once again Deputy Prime Minister alongside Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).\n\nThe man responsible for Barisan Nasional throwing its support behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has made a grand but controversial return to the office he occupied from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIt is the mother of all ironies that Ahmad Zahid has gone from zero to hero among Pakatan Harapan supporters. They know that without him, Anwar would not be where he is.\n\nIt has not been easy for Anwar to accommodate the demands of his new partners.\n\nBarisan felt it deserved portfolios that befit its role as kingmaker while GPS had its own Sarawak-centric priorities.\n\nAnwar promised a lean Cabinet but the end result was anything but lean.\n\nThere are a total of 25 ministers with another three portfolios held by the Prime Minister and the two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nIt is only slightly less crowded than the previous 33-person Cabinet.\n\nThe most interesting part of Anwar\u2019s Cabinet was in the economic appointments.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose top priority is economic recovery, is also Finance Minister.\n\nFormer Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Hassan Marican has been roped in as an economic adviser because the reputed technocrat can help inject investor confidence.\n\nPandan MP Rafizi Ramli, whose supporters wanted him for the finance post, is Economy Minister.\n\nThe odd man out in the economic box is International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz who was certainly not in Anwar\u2019s shortlist of candidates.\n\nThis is the second time that Tengku Zafrul, who lost in Kuala Selangor in the recent elections, is making a back door entry into the Cabinet.\n\nIt is a rather mixed bag of personalities that has been entrusted to revive the economy.\n\nThe same could be said for the general line-up, too.\n\n\u201cIt is a line-up of younger and fresher faces especially those from PKR. They will bring down the average age of the Cabinet, making it the youngest Cabinet we\u2019ve had in a long while,\u201d said political commentator Khaw Veon Szu.\n\nIt is also no coincidence that most of the ministers are Malays and Bumiputera.\n\nAnwar understands the power of optics, especially given that the opposition bench is almost entirely Malay and Muslim.\n\nA total of 15 portfolios went to Pakatan with PKR taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nSome think the political animal in Anwar is moving to strengthen his party.\n\nBut the fact is that PKR is a genuinely multiracial party, its leaders are well-educated, they do not harp on race and religion and they represent a Malaysia that many of us want to see.\n\nThose appointed are there on their own merit.\n\nWas it a strategic move for DAP to accept only four ministerships? Was it to puncture accusations that DAP dominates the government?\n\nDAP\u2019s portfolios \u2013 Transport, Local Government, Youth and Sports and Human Resources \u2013 are important and will enable the party to reach out to its base.\n\nIts Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo was said to have declined a seat in the Cabinet.\n\nAnwar\u2019s other concern is to ensure that his government survives a full term and that means keeping his partners contented so they do not get up to any mischief.\n\nBoth Barisan and GPS got almost equal treatment although Ahmad Zahid was obviously the big winner, landing the Rural Development portfolio. It is a coveted ministry because of its outreach to the Malay heartland.\n\nBut some things are not meant to be and Rembau MP Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who many thought would be the Deputy Prime Minister, ended up in Defence.\n\nAnwar has eased into the job quite smoothly, be it the outpouring of support and attention wherever he goes to audiences at the palace.\n\nAnyone else would have been overwhelmed by the sudden transition from Opposition leader to Prime Minister.\n\nHe has also set several admirable dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 open tenders for projects, no new official car, no unnecessary renovations to his office, no gifts and no salary for himself.\n\nThe air is still filled with euphoria over the rise of Anwar and it has been quite comical and sad too to watch Pakatan supporters fall over themselves trying to justify partnering with Umno and downplaying corruption issues.\n\nSome call it pragmatism. Others say it is for the sake of stability.\n\nActually, it is Machiavellian politics at its best where the end justifies the means.\n\nBut nobody wants to see more political instability and that is why Anwar should get a chance to do his job for the next five years.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",

        "PETALING JAYA: When the country goes to the polls on Saturday, the big question will not be so much about who will win, but whether a a new government can be formed to lead the nation soon.\n\nThis is because there is a likelihood that no party or coalition will be able to get a simple majority of 112 seats in the 222-seat Parliament.\n\nThat would trigger some frenetic negotiations over several days among party leaders, making the post-elections scenario even more tense than the 14-day campaign itself.\n\nIt could well go back to the hands of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, say constitutional experts.\n\nIn the event of a hung Parliament, the King could help resolve the impasse by giving parties time to negotiate and cobble together an umbrella coalition with the required majority, constitutional lawyer Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar said.\n\n\u201cThe coalition with the most seats can then enter into discussions with others to secure a majority. The party with the next highest number of seats can also do the same.\n\n\u201cWhoever secures a majority can then present the outcome to the king and ask him to appoint their chosen leader,\u201d he said.\n\nUniversiti Malaya Prof Shad Saleem Faruqi, in a recent article in The Star, said the King was not bound to appoint the leader of the party that has more seats than all other parties if there is a hung Parliament.\n\n\u201cHe may give a chance to anyone who, in his opinion, can put together a working majority.\n\n\u201cThe appointments of prime ministers in 2020 and 2021 are cases in point,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that there are no written provisions in the Constitution on how the King should exercise his wisdom in determining who has the majority support.\n\n\u201cHe may require a vote of confidence in Parliament or he may interview individual MPs (as the King did in 2020). Affidavits may also be accepted or party leaders interviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nIf unresolved, the King could even appoint a minority government that can work with the Opposition through a Confidence and Supply Agreement.\n\n\u201cIn this arrangement, the Opposition promises support on major issues but stays out of government,\u201d he said.\n\nAlternatively, a unity government could be formed with the encouragement of the King.\n\nSuch a government can be stable but it may suffer from being too bloated as many people have to be pleased, he said.\n\nSenior lawyer Mohd Haniff Khatri Abdulla said that, if there was no simple majority, the King will have to determine if anyone commands the support of the majority.\n\n\u201cThe King will have to invite leaders of the political parties which have the most number of seats for the purpose,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was the case when former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad resigned on Feb 24, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe King appointed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister five days later after he secured the support of the majority of MPs,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also happened when Muhyiddin resigned on Aug 16 last year. Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was appointed by the King four days later.\n\n\u201cThe King may allow for several days or a week of negotiations. It would be unreasonable if negotiations go on for a month,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil then, the King may appoint an interim prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe interim prime minister can be any MP who need not command the majority support in the House but has the respect of the people.\u201d\n\nOnce a leader is deemed to have the majority support, Mohd Haniff said he could then be appointed as prime minister.\n\nSo far, Barisan Nasional election director Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, Pakatan Harapan chairman Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Perikatan chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin have all expressed confidence that they could get the 112 seats to form the government.Research houses, however, say that surveys show that no one coalition would be able to do so, with possibly none of them even breaching the 100-seat mark.",
        "SEREMBAN: The appointment of a private entity, MySJ Sdn Bhd, through a direct negotiation mechanism rather than an open tender exercise to manage the next phase of the MySejahtera app is worrying, says Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan.\n\nThe Umno deputy president said the people had the right to know the rationale, motives and capabilities of the entity involved in managing the MySejahtera app.\n\n\u201cThe app was developed for the purpose of monitoring the spread of Covid-19 and has been very helpful and useful.\n\n\u201cBut reports on the appointment of MySJ as a company that will be managing the MySejahtera app for the next phase is rather worrying,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nMohamad said although the Health Ministry had provided an explanation, some questions still needed to be answered.\n\n\u201cThis is because the decision involves the management of personal data, health information, movements and life trends of tens of millions of Malaysians.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that this app was initially developed as a corporate social responsibility to deal with a contagious pandemic,\u201d he added.\n\nAny purpose other than pandemic control would require the government to conduct a comprehensive study with all stakeholders, especially Malaysians, he said.\n\nHe also said plans to upgrade the app\u2019s use such as to facilitate organ donation or any other health matters, although beneficial, were not in line with its original purpose.\n\n\u201cIf there are plans to upgrade and diversify MySejahtera\u2019s functions, a check and balance mechanism should be put in place to ensure the integrity of personal and medical information is not compromised.\n\n\u201cThe government should also decide on the rationale for continuing registration through MySejahtera and the obligation to activate MySJTrace,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that Malaysians should not be burdened with a surveillance-like mechanism that directly invaded the privacy of their movements and daily lives.\n\n\u201cDetermine the period of time for the sake of normalising the lives of Malaysians, just like before the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said being transparent was important in strengthening the people\u2019s confidence in the government\u2019s plan to expand MySejahtera beyond its original function.",

Ravi was state number two.\n\nWhen Tanggam moved to the Rembau division and became its head, he was made vice chairman II while Ravi remained as deputy.\n\nAsked on his decision not to re-appoint four state assemblymen from the party to senior positions in the state liaison committee this time around, Aminuddin said this was normal.\n\nHe said it was also wrong to indicate that they would be dropped from contesting in the general election just because they no longer held senior positions in the state lineup.\n\nThe four were state legislative assembly Deputy Speaker and Sri Tanjung assemblyman Datuk M. Ravi, state excos Datuk Dr Mohamad Rafie Ab Malek (Ampangan), Mohamad Nazaruddin Sabtu (Pilah) and Datuk Michael Yek (Chuah).\n\nThe four are now just normal committee members by virtue of being appointed by Aminuddin.\n\n\"It does not mean that one must be given a senior position in the state committee just because you are an assemblyman.\n\n\"It is just like in Melaka where Datuk Seri Shamsul Iskandar Mohd Akin, who is known to everyone, is now only a committee member,\" he said.\n\nShamsul, who is Hang Tuah Jaya MP, had lost in his bid for the top post in the Hang Tuah Jaya party polls.\n\n\"As members, we need to accept changes.\n\n\"I am also the head of Melaka PKR now, but this post will also go once the general election is over,\" he said.\n\nAminuddin said it was the same in other states, where a position as MP or assemblyman does not guarantee one a senior post in the party.\n\nAminuddin said the party president will have the final say on the party's candidates for the coming general election.\n\n\"The same rule applies to me. I can also be dropped at the last minute.\n\n\"The president has the veto power after discussions are held at the lower level, including by a committee set up to vet the potential candidates,\" he said, adding that he would abide by the decision in the event he was asked to sit out the general election.",

We intend to carry out the programme in other schemes where we own land,\" he said.\n\nHe said successful applicants would be allowed to design their own houses based on affordability.\n\nThe move, he said, would also help cushion the effects of a labour crunch faced in some schemes.\n\n\"They can either continue to work in the schemes or run their own businesses. The choice will be theirs,\" he said.\n\nOn a separate matter, Aminuddin said state civil servants who register as volunteers and are roped in to help victims in the event of floods will be entitled to unrecorded leave.\n\nHe expressed hope that private sector employers would also consider providing this privilege to their employees who register as volunteers and are called upon to help victims.",

Of these, 11 are held by the DAP, PKR (six) and Amanah (three).\n\nIn the 2018 general election, PKR contested the most number of state seats with 12, followed by DAP (11), Amanah (seven) and Bersatu (six).",

        "PETALING JAYA: With Covid-19 at the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind since 2020, another virus has been present in its shadow \u2013 the influenza.\n\nHealth experts said influenza \u2013 not to be confused with the common cold \u2013 was not something to be swept under the rug, given the severe drawbacks that could arise from contracting the virus.\n\nThey say the best form of protection against influenza was getting the yearly vaccine, as the virus could mutate over time.\n\nImmunise4Life programme technical committee chairman Prof Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail said many were unaware of the complications that could arise from influenza.\n\n\u201cThe influenza is a recurring infection that can cause severe disease especially in the elderly and the very young. Those with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease are also at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained how influenza would affect blood glucose control in diabetic individuals, which could lead to either hyperglycaemic or hypoglycaemic comas.\n\n\u201cThose with underlying heart disease also have a higher risk of getting a heart attack. The elderly also have weakened lungs that predisposes them to pneumonia and bacterial infection by pneumococcus,\u201d he said.\n\nOn vaccination, Prof Zulkifli said individuals could receive both the Covid-19 and influenza jabs at the same time.\n\n\u201cMost facilities will, however, separate them into different days with at least a two-week interval between them.\n\n\u201cInfluenza jabs are available at all private healthcare facilities but may require some prior arrangements in order to get them,\u201d he said, adding that the cost ranged between RM60 and RM150 depending on the facility and the brand.\n\nMalaysian Society of Infectious Diseases and Chemotherapy president Prof Dr Zamberi Sekawi also noted that influenza was not something to be taken lightly.\n\nHe said the relaxation of mask mandates indoors could also see a resurgence in the number of flu cases nationwide.\n\n\u201cInfluenza has always been around but seeing how everything was locked down due to Covid-19, there were virtually no cases over the past two years.\n\n\u201cWhen things started to reopen, an increase in influenza cases was observed, with outbreaks also reported,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Zamberi, who is also a consultant clinical microbiologist at Universiti Putra Malaysia, also reiterated that it was safe to receive both the Covid-19 vaccine and flu jabs at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe only condition would be that the jabs are given on different sites of the arm.\n\n\u201cA two-week interval between each jab is also possible, but this is mainly so that medical professionals can identify which jab causes the recipient to experience side effects (if any),\u201d he said.\n\nUniversiti Malaya Medical Centre consultant geriatrician Prof Dr Tan Maw Pin said it was important for those aged 65 years and above to get their flu jabs, in view of the complications that could arise.\n\n\u201cThe flu can be a deadly catalyst for the elderly, as the effects of the infection can last for three to six months, or even more.\n\n\u201cDuring this time frame, the elderly are at a higher risk of getting other infections and also experiencing a loss of appetite.\n\n\u201cThose with comorbidities such as heart complications, among others, also have a higher risk of getting heart attacks,\u201d said Prof Tan.\n\nShe also warned of a potential flu outbreak at year-end.\n\n\u201cNow that mask mandates have been relaxed, there is a higher chance for the flu to spread, with the possibility of Malaysia facing the full brunt of this in December.\n\n\u201cIf the elderly do not get their jabs soonest, there is the grim possibility of the flu outbreak taxing our healthcare system the same way the Covid-19 Delta wave did,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Prof Tan emphasised that getting the flu jab did not mean one would be completely immune to catching the virus.\n\n\u201cInstead, those vaccinated will experience less severe complications,\u201d she said.\n\nUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia\u2019s health economy and public health specialist Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh said it was best to get flu jabs annually as it offered effective protection against constantly mutating virus.\n\n\u201cThe influenza virus has been well studied and also shown to mutate.\n\n\u201cHence, getting the jab yearly is the best form of protection as the vaccine one received a year ago may not be able to effectively provide immunity against the influenza a year later,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, noted that the cost of flu jabs might be a deterrent especially for those from the lower income brackets.\n\n\u201cThe jab can cost up to RM150, depending on where you get them, and this is just for one person.\n\n\u201cWhen you tabulate the cost for all members of a family, the amount can be hard to fork out especially for groups with an already low disposable income.\n\nIn George Town, Dr Kumitaa Theva Das, a virologist from USM, said continuous mask wearing is extremely helpful in curbing influenza.\n\n\u201cThis is because influenza is transmitted through droplets, which spreads easily and quickly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf infected, it can take about a week to one-and-a-half weeks to recover,\u201d she said, highlighting that the flu vaccine is recommended to be taken annually for two reasons.\n\n\u201cThe first is that the body\u2019s immune response to influenza decreases over time and the vaccine ensures continuous protection.\n\n\u201cThe second reason is that just like Covid-19, the influenza virus is constantly changing, so being up-to-date on influenza vaccines enables maximum protection.\u201d\n\nHer counterpart, Assoc Prof Dr Venugopal Balakrishan, said it was very easy to get a flu shot at clinics.\n\n\u201cThe price may vary from clinic to clinic or hospital but usually it is less than RM100,\u201d he said, while lamenting that many people are still ignorant and refused to take the flu jab, despite its benefits.",

        "PETALING JAYA: Experts have called on new Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa to look into the alarming rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the country as one of the main priority areas.\n\nAccording to \u201cThe direct healthcare cost of non-communicable diseases in Malaysia\u201d report released by the Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) in August, Malaysia spent RM22.53bil to treat NCDs such as diabetes, cancer and heart diseases in 2017.\n\nCiting statistics from the National Health and Morbidity Survey, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia health economy and public health specialist Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh said NCDs are the main causes of death and disability in Malaysia.\n\nShe added that it is estimated that one in five adult Malaysians is living with diabetes, one in three living with hypertension and nearly half are overweight or obese.\n\n\u201cNCDs accounted for 67% of premature deaths in Malaysia and over 70% of the burden of disease in 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nMany, she said, are unaware that they are on the verge of developing NCDs.\n\nTherefore, health promotion and education needs to be ramped up, she added.\n\n\u201cWhen the (NCD) burden is high, it means many people are affected. So, the government loses money in managing them,\u201d she said.\n\nApart from that, she said the high cost burden of NCD will also lower productivity, the quality of life and lead to early mortality.\n\nShe said upgrades are needed in terms of number of staffers, drug options and better treatment to manage the NCD burden.\n\nPublic health advocate Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said NCDs such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and chronic obstructive airway disease have been on the rise in the past 10 to 15 years, and will continue to rise in the next few years.\n\nHe said smoking, cholesterol and sugar intake are risk factors for NCDs.\n\nPrevention through healthy lifestyle practices in childhood and adulthood, regular screening and early treatment, physical activities and restricting the intake of harmful substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and food with high fat and sugar content are key to preventing NCDs, he noted.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said in a statement that private hospitals have the infrastructure for the screening of diseases, particularly NCDs, and as an immediate step, the health minister should consider outsourcing to private hospitals to control the increasing complications of such diseases.\n\nThe Health Ministry\u2019s report noted that the total direct healthcare costs of the three selected NCDs - diabetes, cancer and heart diseases - were estimated at RM9.65bil, which did not take into account the estimated loss of productivity to the nation amounting to RM12.88bil.\n\nFor overall expenditure of the NCD category, the estimated total healthcare cost for diabetes was RM4.38bil (45.38%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with RM3.93bil (40.73%) and cancer with RM1.34bil (13.89%), the report read. The study also found that hospitalisation costs amounted to RM1.58bil for the three NCD categories.\n\nThe cost of primary care consultations for the NCDs was about RM4.2bil.\n\nThe study also did not take into account other cost factors related to the three NCDs such as rehabilitation, palliative and long-term care.",

        "This year, we mark our 65th National Day and 59th Malaysia Day. I would like to take this opportunity to continue the conversation we started last year by penning some thoughts on our beloved nation.\n\nWe live in a time of extreme uncertainty. Even as Malaysia and the world transition into the endemic phase, Covid-19 still poses a threat. Tensions between the United States and China have escalated, while the war in Ukraine has disrupted global supply chains.\n\nInflation is soaring and the widening income inequality is reversing decades of hard-earned progress.\n\nGiven these global headwinds, it is even more pertinent that we as Malaysians get our act together, fast, if we are to overcome these challenges.\n\nWe have to take a hard look at where we are today, where we want to go and how we intend to get there.\n\nLet me highlight some positive developments that have happened over the past 12 months.\n\nFor example, the historic memorandum of understanding (MoU) that was signed by the Prime Minister and the Pakatan Harapan opposition coalition is beginning to bear fruit in terms of reforming our political system.\n\nThe anti-party hopping law has been gazetted. A political financing bill will soon be tabled. Parliament is growing in independence as it plays its check-and-balance role.\n\nBut even more crucial is the out-of-the-box thinking that led to the MoU and introduced the concept of \u201ccompete and collaborate\u201d into our political system. It provided a sense of stability that greatly helped the governance of the country. We need more such ideas in order to move forward.\n\nThe government did well to cushion the harshest impact of the rising cost of living for Malaysians, especially for those in the B40 category.\n\nBut it has come at a huge and, clearly, unsustainable cost: almost RM80bil in subsidies.\n\nTan Sri Dato\u2019 Seri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AO\n\nWhile these stop-gap measures have provided temporary aid, what we really need is a set of cohesive, coherent and coordinated long-term policies that can raise productivity levels and the rakyat\u2019s income.\n\nIn the words of the late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, \u201cThere comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they are falling in.\u201d\n\nHowever, like many of my fellow Malaysians, I worry that some in power appear to be more focused on politics, rather than policies.\n\nWe are all aware of the obstacles we face in trying to build a brighter, more progressive, more inclusive and more sustainable future for our country.\n\nLet me share some of them. It is crucial that we acknowledge the pressing need to strengthen our national unity. Our diversity is a strength that enriches us as a nation, not something that divides us.\n\nWe must all do what we can to clean up the toxicity that influences our conversations on race, religion and culture.\n\nAnd then, there is education. It is no secret that our education system needs a massive overhaul. Unless we urgently address this challenge, we will doom our children and our country to a future of poverty and misery.\n\nIn a globalised world, the competition our children face will come not just from the student at the next desk, but from far beyond our borders.\n\nIn this context, I am concerned to learn that the command of English among young Malaysians is on the decline.\n\nObviously, Bahasa Malaysia is our national language and we should know it, but we are a trading nation and English is the language of trade and commerce. A lack of fluency in English may well pose a major hurdle in our efforts to build a prosperous Malaysia.\n\nIn fact, the more languages we are fluent in, the more opportunities we can explore in this globalised world.\n\nThe perception is that corruption has now become endemic in this country. I do not need to go into specific details. You are all aware of the issues and the scandals. Unless we seriously root out corruption, we are in trouble.\n\nLike how cancer attacks a body from within, corruption is a disease that can destroy a country and a society from the inside out.\n\nAllowing corruption to go unchecked is like injecting poison into a body. Corruption is a two-way street involving a giver and a taker.\n\nBattling it will require not only strong laws implemented without fear or favour, but also a change in mindset and culture among all of us. How exactly do we achieve this?\n\nThe recent decisions by the courts on corruption cases have sparked hope. The judiciary\u2019s upholding of its institutional integrity is a huge step forward in this war against corruption.\n\nLet us bear in mind that even as we address these political and socio-economic issues, we do so at a time when climate change threatens the very survival of humanity.\n\nImplementing the sustainable development agenda is no longer an option, but an urgent imperative.\n\nThe path has already been charted for us. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, lay out a holistic and comprehensive roadmap.\n\nBut realising the 17 SDGs is not the role of governments alone.\n\nIt requires the commitment of every element of society \u2013 the private sector, academia, civil society and every single one of us.\n\nWe are all in this together.\n\nTan Sri Dato\u2019 Seri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AO\n\nA concerned citizen of Malaysia",

        "PETALING JAYA: A vote of confidence for the Prime Minister will be the first item on the agenda when the 15th Parliament sits on Dec 19.\n\nThis follows Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s acceptance of a challenge thrown at him by Perikatan Nasional chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin to prove he has the numbers.\n\nMuhyiddin had also claimed that he had enough support to be Prime Minister immediately after the general election, before the impasse was resolved when the King appointed Anwar to the post.\n\nThere are a few ways that the vote can be done, said outgoing Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun (pic).\n\nAzhar, who has been the Dewan Rakyat Speaker over the past two administrations since July 2020, said a vote of confidence can be moved on the first day of the Parliament, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony of the new Members of Parliament but before the King\u2019s speech.\n\nAzhar said a government MP would first have to file for the suspension of the King\u2019s speech.\n\nIt would not be a first for the Dewan Rakyat, as it was done in 1999 by then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was facing calls to surrender his premiership.\n\n\u201cWhen Parliament convenes on Dec 19, the first order of the day would be to elect the Speaker and Deputy Speakers, swearing in the MPs, and then the King\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cThe move for the vote of confidence must be made by a government MP who is a minister, as only then can the vote be pushed up in the priority list as government business. Otherwise, it will be pushed to the lower end of the pile.\n\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, a vote for the Budget is usually a vote of confidence for a Prime Minister. However, as a mini-budget is pending, a vote for that too can be turned into a vote of confidence.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister has to get the Speaker to announce that it would be treated as a vote of confidence,\u201d he said.\n\nAzhar, however, pointed out that a vote for the mini-budget might not necessarily reflect the real confidence as most MPs would not want to vote against a mini-budget. That might mean the postponement of civil servants\u2019 salaries and the government\u2019s operational expenses.\n\n\u201cThose who vote for the mini-budget would do so to ensure civil servants\u2019 salaries are paid and the government continues to operate,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that the history of the UK Parliament, upon which the Malaysian Parliament is modelled, has shown that there are other ways of getting a vote of confidence.\n\nIn March 1944, then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill insisted that the House of Commons reverse a vote in favour of equal pay for women teachers.\n\nAzhar said Churchill had opposed equal pay for women teachers, but he was defeated when the Bill was passed.\n\n\u201cChurchill, without discussing the merits of the issue, insisted that the Bill be refiled and be treated as an issue of confidence.\n\n\u201cHe succeeded in persuading the House to delete the clause in question, by an overwhelming majority,\u201d said Azhar.\n\nHe pointed out that Churchill then saw the female teacher pay-equality Bill as an opportunity for squashing opposition in general.\n\nAzhar also said a vote on the King\u2019s speech can be considered as a vote of confidence for the government of the day.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to our culture here, it is most unlikely ever to happen. No MP would vote against the King\u2019s speech,\u201d said Azhar.",
        "THE youth and sports fraternity has been waiting with bated breath for who the new minister in charge will be.\n\nNow that Hannah Yeoh has been named for the job, one hopes she will be a competent and dynamic minister to carry the aspirations of the youth in serving out this portfolio.\n\nAfter all, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will have high hopes for her. The Prime Minister himself once served as Culture, Youth and Sports Minister for about a year before moving on to more senior portfolios.\n\nThe Youth and Sports Ministry has always been the training ground for future Prime Ministers with the likes of Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob all having served in the portfolio before.\n\nWhat most people will be hoping is that the new minister in the job will last for at least one term.\n\nWe certainly miss the days when the national sports family could have a go-to minister for a period of five years. The last one to have served a full term was Khairy Jamaluddin from 2013 to 2018.\n\nSince then, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman served from July 2018 to February 2020 when the Sheraton Move felled him. He was replaced by Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican from March 2020 until August 2021 when the Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin government fell.\n\nDatuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu took over only to lose his Tambun seat in the recent elections.\n\nFive years is already a relatively short term when one talks about grooming world beaters or Olympic champions but it should be enough to implement changes or lay out the foundations for new ideas.\n\nBut these three previous ministers hardly had any time to implement policies, much less see the fruits of their work.\n\nSyed Saddiq was the youngest ever minister when he was named to the post but had to deal with the expectations of the Malaysian public after the national contingent failed to secure its target of 70 golds in the 2019 Manila SEA Games. They only managed 56 golds.\n\nReezal Merican took over at a time when the country was facing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and his hands were tied as a result.\n\nHowever, Reezal was a good supporter of sports and initiated the National Sports Vision 2030 while presiding over the contingent\u2019s performance at the Tokyo Olympics, which was delayed by a year because of the pandemic.\n\nThe outgoing minister Ahmad Faizal perhaps had the satisfaction of seeing the nation ending its long wait for a badminton world champion with men\u2019s doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik clinching the title in Tokyo.\n\nFaizal was also in charge when the national football team ended a 42-year wait to qualify for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup finals taking place in Qatar.\n\nTo be fair, much of it was not Faizal\u2019s success \u2013 he just did not do much tinkering with the policies laid in place by his predecessors.\n\nPerhaps what most people involved in the sports fratenity would like to see is for the new appointee to concentrate on strengthening the current policies and not try to create his own legacy, which may backfire.\n\nNew ministers often come in with new ideas but these get shunted aside when someone else takes over.\n\nDatuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein was into extreme sports and Kuala Lumpur hosted the Asian X-Games while Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, who was the first woman Sports Minister, focused on women in sports.\n\nKhairy came up with the Fit Malaysia and National Sports Day while Syed Saddiq went for esports.All these ideas have disappeared along with the ministers. We can assume there could also be a review of the proposal to build drag circuits around the country with RM20mil already allocated under the Budget. Anwar, after all, has expressed his desire to cut down on unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWhat we really need is an entrenched sports policy that everyone who comes in can help to strengthen.\n\nIt will not be fair for the new minister to be answerable for the performance of the contingent at the Asian Games in Hangzhou next year or the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWhat she can do is address the decline of young talent coming through the ranks and how to get the public to be more active.\n\nThere has also been a decline in young talents coming through the schools. Outside of schools, there is a need for more sporting activities and initiatives for the masses which can create a sporting eco-system.\n\nThe big goal is to turn Malaysia into a truly sporting nation \u2013 and to let sports remain as the best unifying tool.",
        "PETALING JAYA: Prime Ministers of the past three governments took different approaches in forming their Cabinets, which resulted in varying timelines before the entire line-up was made visible.\n\nWhen Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad was sworn in as the seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018, he announced his Cabinet in stages, with the first line-up of three senior ministers named on May 12.\n\nAnother list of nine ministers was announced eight days after his swearing in, while the entire line-up was only made clear several weeks later.\n\nDr Mahathir\u2019s full list was expanded by 13 ministries, with 13 ministers and 23 deputy ministers beginning their tenures on July 2, 2018.\n\nTan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin was officially sworn in as the eighth Prime Minister on March 1, 2020.\n\nHe announced his full Cabinet line-up on March 9, eight days later.\n\nDatuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was sworn in as the ninth Prime Minister on Aug 21 last year, and announced his full Cabinet on Aug 27, nearly a week later.\n\nDr Mahathir\u2019s Cabinet consisted of 28 ministers, while both Muhyiddin and Ismail Sabri\u2019s line-up had 32 ministers each.",
        "The global spotlight wouldn\u2019t be anything new for Malaysia\u2019s 10th Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cWILL Anwar be Prime Minister?\u201d was the most asked question when I was in Bangkok last week. At that time, Pakatan Harapan chairman Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Perikatan Nasional chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin were vying to be Malaysia\u2019s 10th prime minister.\n\nI was in Thailand last Thursday to give a talk on \u201cChallenges and Roles for Asian Media\u201d organised by Thai PBS (Public Broadcasting Service), Thai PBS World and Asia News Network (ANN). Journalists from around Asia \u2013 including from India, the Philippines and Indonesia \u2013 and Thai politicians, including former Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, were keen to know whether the PKR president would finally realise his dream of becoming PM.\n\nNattha Komolvaldhin, Thai PBS World director who was the talk\u2019s moderator, asked me to comment on Malaysian politics in the 15th General Election on behalf of an audience that seemed keen to know more about Malaysian politics.\n\nI told them that, earlier, the King had announced that Anwar was the PM.\n\nI related to them that the day before, a question raised was whether Anwar would be made PM solely because there are, arguably, only three Malaysian leaders the world knows: Anwar, twice prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad (no explanation needed to understand why), and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak (for all the wrong reasons).\n\nNot many people were talking about Muhyiddin, who was poised to become PM for a second time.\n\nI told the crowd that Anwar was known worldwide because he craved the international limelight. I covered deputy prime minister and finance minister Anwar when he was Umno deputy president in the late 1990s, and he was an international media darling.\n\nFor example, Anwar was on the cover of the Oct 6, 1997, Time magazine under the headline: \u201cAnwar and the Future of Asia: Malaysia\u2019s No.2 is the star of a rising generation of leaders, but will Mahathir give him a chance?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that Anwar is PM, he will consolidate his position and sooner or later step into the international limelight. Now that he is a Malaysian leader, he will want to become a world leader,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHe will want to win a Nobel Prize,\u201d I joked. Sort of.\n\nI ended my comment by addressing the Indian, Filipino and Indonesian journalists who were fellow panellists and said, \u201cWatch out, Jokowi, Bong Bong Marcos and Modi, there\u2019s a new kid on the world block\u201d.\n\nI was referring to Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, Philippines President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nOver the next few days, I met up with Bangkok-based journalists who were on a first-name basis with the new Malaysian Prime Minister.\n\nUnlike former prime ministers Muhyiddin or Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, Anwar engages with the international media. For example, in September this year, he gave a talk at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand in Bangkok -- \u201cI met Anwar recently in Bangkok,\u201d a foreign correspondent told me.\n\nI also met some people who are experts in the southern Thailand conflict that has taken the lives of nearly 7,000 people since 2004.\n\nI\u2019m familiar with the deadly conflict. As ANN editor and Star Media Group Bhd Thailand correspondent based in Bangkok from 2006 to 2010, I visited the region, which comprises Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala provinces, and which runs along Peninsular Malaysia\u2019s northern border. The Thai government is battling an unseen enemy seeking \u201cMerdeka\u201d for the Pattani region, which Kelantan used to be a part of. Last month, a police officer was killed and at least 29 people were injured when a car bomb exploded inside a police compound in Narathiwat province.\n\nMalaysia is brokering peace between Bangkok and the insurgents. But nothing much has moved since the peace talks started in 2013 when the \u201cGeneral Consensus on Peace Dialogue Process\u201d pact was signed between Thailand\u2019s National Security Council and the BRN (Barisan Revolusi Nasional or National Revolutionary Front).\n\nThe Malaysian facilitator for the talks is former Malaysian inspector-general of police Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Mohd Noor, who was jailed for two months in 2001 for assaulting Anwar while the former deputy prime minister was in jail in 1998.\n\n\u201cPM Anwar probably will replace Rahim Noor as a facilitator, not because of the punching incident but because the facilitator is inefficient. He sometimes forgets what he has for breakfast, and he\u2019s too fierce to be a facilitator,\u201d said one of the Thai experts I spoke to.\n\nHe said that Anwar was interested in the conflict even when he was an Opposition leader.\n\n\u201cAnwar has a deep understanding of the conflict. And he wanted to bring peace to the region. I won\u2019t be surprised that your Prime Minister will expedite bringing peace to the Pattani region,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the expert cautioned that the southern Thailand conflict might not have a political solution.\n\n\u201cThe Thai government wants the insurgents to accept the Thai Constitution, which means they would have to recognise that Pattani is under the Thai government. But the insurgents want Merdeka, which Bangkok won\u2019t allow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut never say \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 to Anwar as he will take it as a challenge to be the world leader who can bring peace to southern Thailand.\u201d\n\nJokowi, Bong Bong and Modi, you\u2019ve been warned \u2013 Anwar will take his rightful place as an Asian leader.",

        "IT\u2019S a relief to finally have a prime minister.\n\nAfter almost a week of political gridlock, it took the royal institution to break the impasse and bring an end to one of the country\u2019s most divisive general elections.\n\nGiven the tone of the campaigning leading up to voting day, and indeed the tone of political discourse in the past three years, all the experts predicted a hung Parliament, so nobody was really surprised when two coalitions claimed to hold enough of a majority to form the government on Nov 19.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, anyone? Remember the Sheraton Move, party hopping, the numbers game with ever-changing statutory declarations, all of which led to three changes of governments in as many years?\n\nWe hoped the 15th General Election would put a stop to the revolving door at Putrajaya and bring much needed stability to the country.\n\nAnd it has done that. We hope. We say \u201chope\u201d because the new government is a fragile thing that is something entirely new to Malaysia: a unity government.\n\nA unity government is one in which rival political parties form a bloc that governs together.\n\nIt sounds complicated, and it is, but it has proven to work in many parts of the world, with South Africa being, arguably, the most famous example; there are also unity governments in Italy, Greece, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Zimbabwe, Kenya and more.\n\nMany say a unity government is actually a sign that an electorate is maturing and really grasping democratic processes and power-sharing.\n\nThat we came to it without any violence is also a positive thing, and for that we have the King and Malay Rulers to thank.\n\nWhile their suggestion to form this type of government was rejected by Perikatan Nasional chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim managed to get the backing of other political parties, mainly Barisan Nasional and GPS (Gabungan Parti Sarawak), to forge the government.\n\nWhen Muhyiddin challenged Anwar\u2019s numbers, the new PM responded by saying that Parliament will call for a confirmatory vote of confidence when it convenes on Dec 19.\n\nPolitical reformists have been calling for this parliamentary convention for years, as the process confirms the legitimacy of a new government and lends stability. And stability is something Malaysia sorely needs.\n\nThe political uncertainties of the last few years have hurt our economy and made investors jittery.\n\nThat stability helps was proven when, less than a day after the palace made the announcement about Anwar, the Malaysian stock exchange and ringgit both rebounded.\n\nWe don\u2019t need any other numbers to come into play on Dec 19 when the confidence vote is called, no more statutory declarations and horse-trading.\n\nEven if they can\u2019t put aside ideological differences completely, politicians must learn the art of compromise to give the unity government a chance to prove itself and face economic challenges on a sure footing.\n\nNext year is set to be a tough one, with growth slowing significantly globally and regionally. Malaysia\u2019s GDP has been forecast to grow only 4% to 5% next year after posting a growth rate of 6.5% to 7% this year.\n\nSo Malaysians, citizens, politicians and all, must come together now to ensure a stable government to restore the economic landscape and national development.",

Two others have been left hanging.\n\n\u201cIf he (Liew) is dropping incumbents merely to get rid of those from other factions, this is not right,\u201d he said, adding that DAP\u2019s strategy should be to retain those who have served the people well.\n\nHe said with the strict SOP during Covid-19, people would not even know who the new faces are from DAP.\n\nAsked if he would leave the party if dropped, he said he joined DAP to serve and would continue.\n\nMeanwhile, Johor Indian Business Association president P.

        "You can\u2019t please everyone all the time, but Malaysia has, at least, resolution and a way forward now.\n\nIT\u2019S infinitely unnerving when politicians rely on a combination of race and religious issues to garner support.\n\nSocial media is littered with videos of these politicians dangerously peddling their lethal and toxic sentiments to push their desperate agendas.\n\nUnfortunately, these tactics appear to have worked for certain parties, as evidenced by the votes in the recent 15th General Election (GE15).\n\nIt may seem preposterous but there\u2019s certainly a market for such toxic stories, buyers of which, tragically, include young voters.\n\nALSO READ: Need for credibility, clarity, consistency and certainty\n\nThe majority of Undi18 votes, unfortunately, went to those who advocated hard-line religious practices.\n\nIronically, one of the prime movers of Undi18, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, nearly lost his seat.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to attack corrupt politicians and suggest an alternative, but the treacherous level it has degenerated to is an entirely different prospect.\n\nFrom promising a passage to heaven to Jewish plots and an alleged Chinese-led unity government, it has become a no-holds-barred onslaught.\n\nThe Prime Minister has found himself accused of being an Israeli spy, while others have been called LBGT+ supporters and communists, thanks to one imaginative and fertile mind.\n\nEven the Rulers have been criticised, although in a more subtle way, but the tone of discontent is palpable. They have ignored the line, for sure.\n\nThe election is over. His Majesty called for a unity government with Perikatan Nasional \u2013 comprising Bersatu, with PAS \u2013 invited to join the government, but Perikatan declined.\n\nIt was no surprise because Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin wouldn\u2019t have fancied playing obliging subordinate to Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who was the choice of the Rulers for PM.\n\nWhile Bersatu leaders have stated their preference to be in the Opposition, PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang\u2019s hysterical outbursts haven\u2019t quite tickled Malaysians\u2019 funny bones.\n\nHe may have 49 Members of Parliament but he must surely feel anguished at being out of power at the federal level, especially with such a big bloc of lawmakers.\n\nBut PAS needs to get a grip.\n\nThe events of GE15, which led to an inconclusive result, have proven that no single political coalition can form a government without the participation of all Malaysians, including Sabahans and Sarawakians.\n\nNo doubt Perikatan has won over the Malay heartland, especially the \u201cfixed deposits\u201d of Felda settlers, and even the Putrajaya constituency, the government\u2019s seat.\n\nBut Perikatan can\u2019t hope to form a government if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t subscribe to PAS\u2019 politics.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the Opposition is now nearly all- Malay, but, fortunately, the government bench is more diverse. There\u2019s obviously nothing for PAS to brag about.\n\nThe party needs modern and progressive leaders if it hopes to achieve its aim. It needs a kinder and more open narrative to win over the rest of Malaysia, and not just the East Coast of the peninsula.\n\nPAS is arguably regarded as a party dominated by religious leaders with qualifications from West Asia, but lacking strong fundamentals in finance, economics and the sciences.\n\nA constant barrage of statements reeking of Talibanism isn\u2019t going to help them.\n\nUmno will now need to work on its lost Malay ground. It must cleanse itself of its tainted and corrupt image which has scarred the party.\n\nPresident Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, like it or not, has plenty of work to do. He can\u2019t preach the virtues of being in a unity government and be seen as the person who almost single- handedly killed Umno and Barisan Nasional.\n\nPerlis fell to Perikatan by default, and now the state has a PAS Mentri Besar for the first time.\n\nThe polls are over. Malaysia needs to get back to work and brace itself for a tough 2023. There\u2019s simply no time for unproductive politics.\n\nIt\u2019s better for the new Federal Government to dedicate itself to making Malaysia a country we can all be proud of, with the rest of the world viewing us favourably.\n\nLeave the dogmatic religious hardliners alone. Stop talking of banning PAS or arresting its leaders, as we will only create martyrs of them, an because, ultimately, it\u2019s more important that the unity government proves its mettle.\n\nIf needed, appoint good PAS lawmakers who can contribute to their positions. Why not? There is good talent in all parties, and on both sides of the divide, too.\n\nLet bipartisan politics be a part of a developing, mature democracy, where substance matters more than form.\n\nAs Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu said in The Art of War, \u201cKeep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer\u201d.\n\nIf the unity government is genuine, let it be an inclusive government.\n\nThose of us who know Anwar will concur that he doesn\u2019t give up on anyone. He will meet everyone, including those who\u2019ve bad-mouthed him, to win them over.\n\nHis policy has always been that if he can\u2019t have them aligned with him, he would want them to, at least, not oppose him. It will be harder this time, though.",
        "Here\u2019s a look at the pay and allowances our elected reps get, and it\u2019s a pretty sweet deal.\n\nI AM writing this week\u2019s column on Monday, a public holiday, courtesy of our newest Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nWe can thank YAB for it but let this be his last \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d crowd-pleasing act. It was a nice but unnecessary gesture. In fact, it was more disruptive, especially to businesses and schools, than helpful.\n\nInstead, what we need from Anwar and his government is hard evidence that they will be able to effect changes that can finally bring about Malaysia Baru. And it starts with how he assembles his Cabinet which he assures us will be lean and mean. But we also want ministers who are people of calibre, intelligent, efficient and with integrity.\n\nOn that, everyone \u2013 from politicians, commentators, academics and NGOs to retired civil servants and the public \u2013 has his or her take on it. Whether Anwar has had the time to watch or read the deluge of advice, suggestions and even veiled threats is something else. He\u2019s keeping it very close to his chest; we don\u2019t even know who his closest and most trusted advisers are.\n\nAnyway, Aunty here will refrain from joining the \u201ccan I advise you something\u201d cluster. Instead, inspired by Anwar\u2019s promise to cut his and his minister\u2019s salaries and allowances, I will take a look at how much our elected representatives are worth in terms of pay and allowances.\n\nThis is an issue that\u2019s been close to my heart ever since I wrote a feature article published in The Star on March 31, 1989, in which I compared the rewards given to politicians versus civil servants.\n\nPoliticians were not entitled to pensions or gratuities until the passing of the Administration and Members of Parliament (Pensions and Gratuities) Act 1971.\n\nThat Act was repealed and replaced by the Members of Parliament (Remuneration) Act 1980 [Act 237] which provides for pensions, gratuities, benefits and allowances.\n\nVarious people, including MP for Muar and former Youth and Sports minister Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman, have raised the issue of pension entitlements and allowances for assemblymen, MPs and ministers, which Syed Saddiq claimed could exceed RM100,000 per month for some.\n\nBoth MPs and state assemblymen (adun) are paid salaries and enjoy many allowances and benefits. There is an even longer list of rewards for the PM, DPM and Cabinet ministers but due to space constraints, I will focus on what serving MPs get.\n\nNow, there is no denying our elected representatives have a lot of work to do and they should be rewarded accordingly. But are they being over-compensated? What are these benefits and allowances?\n\nYou can find them in Statute Paper 235 of 1983 on the Official Portal of Parliament of Malaysia (bit.ly/malaysia_mp).\n\nFirst off, an MP\u2019s monthly salary is RM16,000. He/she also has a phone allowance of RM900 and a fixed travelling allowance of RM1,500 a month without the need to submit any claims.\n\nAn MP is also eligible to receive RM400 a day for attending Parliament and RM300 a day for official meetings, workshops, briefings, seminars, etc; a daily subsistence allowance of RM100 while on official duty within the country or RM170 outside Malaysia; food allowance of RM340 for every night spent outside the country; hotel charges of not more than RM400 a night, if the fixed allowance is not enough to cover all these claims.\n\nThere is also a \u201cspecial payment\u201d of RM1,500 a month for MPs who are not a member of the administration as defined under Clause (2) of Article 160 of the Federal Constitution, meaning he is not a minister, deputy minister, parliamentary secretary or political secretary.\n\nIf they travel by air on official business, they are entitled to business class seats and every month they get allowances for fuel (RM1, 500), toll (RM300) and entertainment (RM2,500).\n\nThey get a driver\u2019s allowance of RM1,500 even if they don\u2019t hire one, so they get paid for driving themselves. Extra benefits include getting a motor vehicle licence or a firearm permit FOC.\n\nThere are many other benefits like allowances for medical care, warm clothing, ceremonial and black tie attire; and loans for cars, housing and computers. All in, our MPs are pretty well looked after.\n\nThe above salary and allowances, which amount to at least RM25,700, while not really exorbitant, is still a very high income for most Malaysians. What\u2019s more, MPs, after completing 36 months of reckonable service, get a pension after they turn 50.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important we elect worthy persons to represent us in Parliament and state assemblies because we are their pay masters.\n\nBesides, they are not expected to fork out any of this money to help their constituents. That\u2019s where development funds and grants come in.\n\nHowever, under both Barisan Nasional and Pakatan Harapan governments, whoever was in power discriminated against those in the Opposition in how funds for MPs were allocated.\n\nIn 2020, Pakatan government MPs reportedly received RM2mil for development, such as facilities for the community, another RM1.5mil for grants and donations, and RM300,000 to run their service centres. Sabahan and Sarawakian MPs got an extra RM500,000. Opposition MPs got a mere RM100,000 as development funds.\n\nThis is patently unfair. Citizens should not be punished for voting for who they want to represent them. Years ago, there were photos of roads being nicely paved in a Barisan constituency that ended right at the border of an Opposition-held seat.\n\nThat\u2019s why there have been calls, including from Bersih chief Thomas Fann, that there should be equal constituency development funding. This can be institutionalised by new legislation to ensure the allocation of funds is dispensed by Parliament and not at the discretion of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nOne of the conditions of Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s government\u2019s memorandum of understanding with Pakatan, signed in Sept 2021, was equal funding for all MPs. That should be still honoured and implemented under Anwar\u2019s government.\n\nIf that is in place, we can judge how fairly, responsibly and with full accountability our MPs spend these precious funds for the betterment of their constituencies.\n\nThey must also show their attendance record, what they have raised or spoken on in the Dewan Rakyat. We can do that by making it mandatory for MPs and assemblymen to publish their report cards just before the annual Budget session in Parliament.\n\nFrom my years as a journalist covering Parliament meetings, many MPs are seat warmers who hardly ever speak on anything, spend more time in the cafeteria and lounges and even leave before the day\u2019s sitting has ended. That\u2019s why the hall is often very empty, barely making the quorum of 26 MPs from the total of 222.\n\nFortunately, there are representatives who do take an active part in the Dewan Rakyat; who study new Bills and debate them; raise issues important to their voters and national interest and are really service oriented; they are on the ground and readily available to attend to the needs of their constituents.\n\nThese are the kind of dedicated, selfless MPs with integrity we want and we have no qualms about paying them well. Probably the finest example we have is former MP for Bukit Bintang Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye. In the present generation of MPs, the one seen as Lee\u2019s most likely successor is the much loved and admired MP for Segambut Hannah Yeoh.\n\nI started this column by saying I won\u2019t tell Anwar who to appoint. But in the best political tradition of backtracking, I will say I do want to see Yeoh appointed to a meaningful ministerial post in the Cabinet.\n\nThe views expressed here are entirely the writer\u2019s own.",

        "WE\u2019RE clearly living in interesting but also strange times. When Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was sworn in as Prime Minister, it was also nomination day for two seats.\n\nThey were the Padang Serai parliamentary and Tioman state seats, where voting had earlier been suspended following the deaths of two contenders.\n\nFascinatingly, Barisan Nasional, which is a member of the Unity Federal Government, is pitted against Pakatan Harapan, which helms the government.\n\nThey will face off in these two places. It will be interesting to see Barisan and Pakatan\u2019s sales pitches.In fact, there will be state elections in Penang and Selangor in seven months, where the two sides will need to outwit each other. And if there\u2019s a by-election in Sarawak, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), which has joined the Federal Government, will find itself in the same awkward situation.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Barisan was accused of being a corrupt coalition, along with Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. The slogan being bandied about then was a vote for Barisan equalled a vote for Ahmad Zahid, who faces a slew of corruption charges.\n\nBut in the past few days, he has been heralded as a saviour who made the unity government a reality. We\u2019ve been encouraged to look at the \u201clarger picture\u201d \u2013 a tainted man is now rescuing us from PAS.\n\nSuddenly, all is forgiven and forgotten. Barisan is no longer a party for traitors who sold their greedy souls for power.\n\nThere was despair earlier, when at one point reports circulated about Barisan being in the Opposition bloc.\n\nAhmad Zahid was also criticised by his rebellious ranks for Umno\u2019s dismal performance, but they then found themselves labelled opportunists instead, for previously wanting to back Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as PM.\n\nIronically, Muhyiddin is the same guy who campaigned against Ahmad Zahid and corruption on his Perikatan Nasional platform. It worked perfectly, as Bersatu, along with PAS, swept the Malay heartland and crushed Umno\u2019s vote bank, including in the Putrajaya parliamentary constituency, which fell to Perikatan.\n\nMalay voters had obviously forgotten this was the same man who warned them about PAS.\n\nBut having 49 PAS MPs was enough to scare off many Malaysians. Not just non-Malays who voted overwhelmingly for Pakatan, but also many Malays, especially those in urban areas.\n\nThe fear of a \u201cGreen Tsunami\u201d, as it\u2019s now branded, with PAS theologians imposing its religious agenda, was just unpalatable for many.\n\nFor a while, those who gloated over Pakatan\u2019s victory also privately wondered if it was a case of being careful what you wish for. They had presumed the rest of the country would share their political allegiance.\n\nPakatan was short of a simple majority while there was the possibility of Perikatan forming a Malay- and Islamic-centric federal government.\n\nBut God works in mysterious ways, goes the adage. Anwar, who was dismissed by many and seen as not fated to be PM, proved everyone wrong. He will turn out to be the best person to take on PAS MPs on the other side.\n\nAnwar may not be a theologian, but he has credentials. He can quote Quranic verses with a smattering of Arabic, and he has plenty of Arab allies, too. Never mind his past controversies because we\u2019re not voting for a priest or ulamak.\n\nHe is surely not an angel but a true-blue politician who will bend rules and principles. Ultimately, though, he\u2019s the best of our lot.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find a Malay leader who enjoys such strong support among non-Muslims.\n\nBut Anwar needs to work his charm on the conservative Muslims who voted for Perikatan. Like it or not, the number of combined votes earned by Perikatan, Barisan, GPS and GRS (Gabungan Rakyat Sabah) is much higher than those handed to Pakatan.\n\nMeanwhile, PAS needs to take a hard look at itself to understand its optics problem. No party or coalition can hope to form a government by preaching to just one community or religion. It would be disastrous for multiracial Malaysia.\n\nPolitics is about selling hope, as Anwar successfully has done. The jury is still out on whether he will deliver on his promises to Malay-sians, so we\u2019ll have to hold him to that.\n\nMany of us who gave up on Malaysia and its politicians have found that, finally, we can recover what we\u2019ve lost and still salvage the situation.\n\nCertainly, our Rulers have placed their faith in Anwar as the man who, in the opinion of the King, can command majority support in the House.\n\nHis Majesty has allowed Anwar to put together a unity government in the shortest time.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to Anwar, as the 10th PM, to prove he can hold the fort and steer us through the many challenges ahead, especially the strong economic headwinds.\n\nHe needs to fix our education system at all levels, as it has progressively gone down the drain. It won\u2019t and can\u2019t be done overnight, but it must begin now.\n\nThere\u2019s no time for vindictive politics or rhetoric, which scarred the 22-month Pakatan government in 2018 and led to unprecedented apologies issued by the DAP recently to close a chapter with GPS.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that politicians shouldn\u2019t be arrogant or resort to burning bridges. After all, no one knows what the future holds.\n\nLet\u2019s hope we see younger Malaysians such as Rafizi Ramli, Hannah Yeoh, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman and Steven Sim, with a balance of experienced MPs from Barisan and GPS, in the Cabinet. Possibly even technocrats appointed to certain ministries.\n\nIt\u2019s wishful thinking, of course. If only Nurul Izzah Anwar, Khairy Jamaluddin and Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz had won. And we hope for more women in the Cabinet.\n\nMalaysia must move on. We are simply worn out from all the politicking.\n\nThere is little time for Anwar to celebrate. Time is not on his side. We want to see results, and quickly, too.\n\nCongratulations Saudara Anwar Ibrahim and may you succeed in restoring Malaysia to its former glory!",

        "SEGi University & Colleges has received the country\u2019s first Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning for Award of Academic Qualifications (APEL.Q) for its Diploma In Early Childhood Education programme.\n\nThe APEL.Q certificate was presented by Malaysia\u2019s Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad to SEGi University & Colleges deputy vice-chancellor (student affairs) and its Faculty of Optometry and Vision Sciences dean Prof Dr Azrin Esmady Ariffin at the APEL Open Day and APEL.Q launching ceremony in Kuala Lumpur Sentral recently.\n\n\u201cAs the pioneer in offering Early Childhood Care & Education (ECCE) programmes, SEGi is delighted that the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) has approved SEGi University & Colleges to offer the Diploma in Early Childhood Education programme through APEL.Q.\n\n\u201cThis means more ECCE practitioners can have greater access to a professional qualification,\u201d said SEGi University & Colleges managing director Stella Lau in a press release dated July 26.\n\nA systematic process introduced by the MQA, APEL involves identifying, documenting and evaluating learning based on prior work and life experiences, such as knowledge, skills and attitudes, to determine an individual\u2019s achievement level.\n\nIn 2011, the MQA introduced the APEL for Access (APEL.A) to provide entry-level access to higher education for working adults.\n\nIn 2016, it undertook the subsequent step to embark on the APEL for Credit Award (APEL.C) to provide an avenue to assess relevant experiential learning of an individual in the form of credit.\n\nAPEL.C aims to avoid duplication of knowledge and save time and cost for individuals to complete a study programme.\n\nMeanwhile, APEL.Q promotes lifelong learning through facilitation of the recognition of prior experiential learning that takes place in the workplace, and other forms of knowledge, such as formal, non-formal, informal, continuing professional development education and training.\n\n\u201cAPEL.Q provides a pathway for working professionals like kindergarten teachers to convert their work experience into a recognised qualification through evaluations and assessments,\u201d Lau explained.\n\nShe added that an individual with a minimum of 10 years of work experience in the field of early childhood education is qualified to apply for the Diploma via APEL.Q. With the diploma, the individual will be able to further pursue a degree.\n\nThe APEL.Q for the Diploma In Early Childhood Education programme is available at SEGi University Kota Damansara.\n\nIn-service teachers who are ineligible for APEL.Q can also study the programme online flexibly at the university.\n\nAt the same time, SEGi offers the two-and-a-half-year Diploma in Early Childhood Education programme across its college campuses in Kota Damansara, Kuala Lumpur, Subang Jaya, Sarawak and Penang.\n\n\u201cEarly childhood education shapes a child\u2019s brain and learning capacity. It is the foundation for a child\u2019s lifelong learning, behaviour and health.\n\n\u201cTo make a real difference, early childhood educators need more than just the mandatory diploma qualification required by the government,\u201d Lau said.",
        "HAVING a degree does not guarantee employment nowadays.\n\nEven with degrees from reputable universities, some fresh graduates still struggle to get a job. Academic performance, as Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad recently pointed out, is not the only factor that determines whether one gets hired.\n\nSpeaking at the Kuala Lumpur Global Youth Summit 2022 on June 20, she revealed that last year\u2019s graduate employability rate stood at 85.5%.\n\nEmployers, she said, are after those who possess knowledge and skills that are relevant to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nThis, she added, range from digital literacy to soft skills.\n\nTo make sure our graduates thrive, they must be equipped with entrepreneurship skills so that they can earn a good living even if they are not able to secure work upon completing their tertiary education, Universiti Malaya (UM) Student Affairs Division Graduate Employability and Career Centre director Dr Iskandar Abdullah offered.\n\nIskandar\n\nIt is good, he said, to prepare students for unexpected challenges, given the current economic uncertainty and fluid job market.\u201cThe current generation is having to cope with job and financial pressures that are on a different scale as compared to their predecessors.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship, which gives them a sense of comfort and security, is a creative and practical way to generate income.\n\n\u201cAt least they have an alternative means of generating income if need be,\u201d he told StarEdu.\n\nIskandar said all university students in Malaysia must undergo a compulsory entrepreneurship course. This is in line with the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 (Higher Education), which aims to cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and a drive to create, rather than to merely seek jobs, among graduates. Although nearly half of UM students from last year\u2019s batch were initially not interested in the entrepreneurship course as they saw it as a waste of time, almost all felt that they had gained invaluable knowledge.\n\nAbout 80% of them, he added, even felt confident enough to start their own businesses.\n\n\u201cSome 10% of our students from the 2021 batch had even registered their businesses with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM).\n\n\u201cWe also had students who managed to generate RM95,588 in sales when they took their businesses online,\u201d he shared.\n\nThe students, he said, continued to receive orders from customers even after the e-business project, which was part of the entrepreneurship course, ended.\n\n\u201cTheir businesses did so well. The students were so excited and motivated by the sales they had achieved through their class project that they went on with the business to earn some extra income,\u201d he said, adding that the project also led to several students setting up online businesses for their family members who were good at making traditional delicacies like muruku, nyonya kuih and sambal.\n\n\u201cThey are not only able to benefit from this entrepreneurship course, but they are also able to create meaningful impact on society.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship is also a means for students to pick up useful soft skills and life skills that conventional academic study is not able to provide. With the right mindset and skills, anyone can start and manage a business,\u201d added Iskandar.Agreeing, Taylor\u2019s University Faculty of Business and Law School of Management and Marketing lecturer Manmeet Kaur Gorchan Singh said entrepreneurship education helps students learn important life skills and become more resilient.\n\nManmeet\n\nThis, she said, would enhance a student\u2019s ability to secure work in the real world.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship involves skills like creative thinking, problem-solving, empathy and teamwork. It also encourages students to think creatively, identify gaps, be innovative, as well as collaborate with others,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe compulsory entrepreneurship course at Taylor\u2019s University is conducted to encourage creativity and innovation.\n\n\u201cIt is also to provide students with a good understanding of how entrepreneurship supports the national economy,\u201d said Manmeet.\n\nShe said students pick up design thinking skills through the course, where they use empathy to identify issues faced by the community and subsequently, develop solutions to those problems.\n\nThese skills, she added, are important as they train the students\u2019 analytical, decision-making and problem-solving skills.\n\n\u201cPitch presentation, which is also taught, is a crucial component of entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cWith the compulsory entrepreneurship education, we hope to guide students in starting their own businesses during the course of their studies or after they graduate so that they are able to stand out in the job market ,\u201d she said, adding that entrepreneurship maximises a graduate\u2019s employability potential.\n\nManmeet said response to all the varsity\u2019s entrepreneurship modules has been good based on the student enrolment numbers.\n\nThis includes the compulsory module; an understanding entrepreneurialism elective for second year students; and the entrepreneurship and small business module for business students.\n\n\u201cAs entrepreneurship is trending now, students want to experience and have a taste of how the entrepreneur\u2019s journey is like by enrolling in these modules even though they may not want to start their own businesses,\u201d she offered.\n\nYoung voices\n\nWe need to have the right circle of people who will support us when we start a business. This is crucial because many people who want to start a business do not receive the encouragement they need. I did not have business knowledge; nor was there anyone to guide me. I did know what to do. But now with eight years of experience behind me, I realised how important it is to have entrepreneurship knowledge when you start out. It\u2019s also important to be willing to adapt and learn when we enter this industry. An an entrepreneur, you must be willing to take action and change your lifestyle. If we have a reason for doing something, we will find a way to achieve success. Trust the process. -Health product company founder Tya Arifin\n\nOne of the hardest things in the initial years was learning to work together as a partnership. Our company has four women leading the business. So many businesses fail because the partners don\u2019t learn to \u2018fight constructively\u2019. There are bound to be disagreements in every partnership but we always made it a point to put our heads together and come up with the best solutions. With business, the key challenge is always the people. To organise the right people in the right roles at the right time is the hardest job for every chief executive officer (CEO). Next come the products. What should you be producing? What about your competitors who make the same thing but at a much lower price? Ultimately, quality does not lie. There is no need to bring down your prices if you know the value of your product. Be confident in the product that you\u2019re putting out. -Sustainable fashion company CEO Katharina Inkiriwang\n\nNote: Tya and Katharina were speakers at the Kuala Lumpur Global Youth Summit 2022",
        "ESTABLISHING a foreign branch campus will bolster Malaysia\u2019s higher education standards.\n\nThis was the idea Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) had in mind when it decided to open a branch campus in Doha, Qatar, making it the first Malaysian public university to do so.\n\nIts Center for Shaping Advanced and Professional Education (UKM Shape) director Prof Datuk Dr Muhammad Hussin said the decision is a win-win for the varsity.\n\n\u201cIt will enable us to enrol more international students and forge stronger ties with the Qatari government.\n\n\u201cThis is also a way of boosting higher education standards by attracting more international students,\u201d he told StarEdu.\n\nIn addition to gaining this educational benefit, he said UKM aims to explore consultancy and research areas in the Middle Eastern country, as well as extend the internationalisation of its programmes to Gulf countries through its Qatar branch.\n\nIn a statement on May 20, the Higher Education Ministry said the first intake of students would start in October this year.\n\nUKM signed a memorandum of agreement in Doha with The Regional Group of Qatar to expand its campus overseas, the ministry said, adding that the latter is a company that manages property development, asset management, agriculture, stock investment and engineering consulting services in Qatar.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at offering four undergraduate programmes with 25 students per programme.\n\n\u201cWe are estimating the total number of enrolment to be around 100 students as a start.\n\n\u201cThe Regional Group of Qatar will be responsible to establish and provide to UKM, at its own costs and expenses, all services, facilities, premises, infrastructure, equipment and necessary materials.\n\n\u201cUKM, on the other hand, will focus on providing the education,\u201d Prof Muhammad said, adding that the management of the UKM Qatar branch campus will be under the Group, including the collection of fees.\n\nHigher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad, who witnessed the signing ceremony in Doha, described it as a new chapter for Malaysian institutions of higher learning, in achieving higher levels of research and innovation, teaching and learning, and consulting and community development, despite facing challenges brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cI am happy that UKM has contributed to this achievement and has taken the next step to expand its internationalisation involvement by expanding its wings to Qatar,\u201d she said in the statement. \u2014 By SANDHYA MENON",
        "EDUCATION remains a clear priority in Budget 2023 as the government continues its efforts in investing towards a brighter future for the next generation.The education sector, comprising the Education and Higher Education Ministries, received 19% of next year\u2019s total allocation.\n\nOf the RM70.7bil set aside for the education sector, RM15.1bil will be channelled to the Higher Education Ministry (MOHE). This marks a 4.2% increment from the RM14.5bil allocated this year.\n\nIn tabling the budget themed \u201cMalaysian Family, Prospering Together\u201d, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz announced a range of higher education-centric initiatives (see graphic) to ensure that the country\u2019s tertiary education system remains competitive on the global stage.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s higher education achievements continue to impress the world. The government is committed to ensuring that Malaysian youths pursue their education until a tertiary level,\u201d he said while tabling the budget on Oct 7.\n\nTengku Zafrul\u2019s announcement included RM3.8bil for scholarships and education loans, and RM6.7bil for various technical and vocational education and training (TVET) initiatives.\n\nIn the official statement of MOHE, it was stated that Budget 2023 reflects the government\u2019s commitment to supporting efforts to drive the well-being of higher education in the country.\n\nThe ministry added that the allocation provided for higher education is \u201cresponsive, responsible and significant\u201d to the stakeholders, community and society.\n\nHigher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad said the allocation provided under the budget will go towards ensuring a brighter future for the country\u2019s youths at higher education institutions (HEIs).\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the children of the Malaysian Family can continue their studies in the HEIs, MOHE has been allocated larger funds in Budget 2023.With that amount, several announcements that focus on cash assistance, the settlement of education loans, and development projects such as the upgrading of digital networks and facilities at HEIs across the country have been made,\u201d she told reporters recently.\n\nBetter access for all\n\nTaking into consideration the rising cost of living, Budget 2023 makes sure that youths, especially those from underprivileged groups, have the opportunity to pursue their dreams by making quality tertiary education accessible.\n\nIt was announced that National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) borrowers would receive a 20% discount if they made a full settlement on their loans, 15% if at least half of the outstanding balance in a single payment was made, and 15% if repayments were made through salary deduction or direct debit.\n\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob recently announced that there would be an increase from 75% to 100% in education loans for students from M40 families and loan repayment exemption for all students who graduated with first-class bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\nThere would also be loans for the purchase of laptops for PTPTN borrowers in this income group, and together with the other benefits, would help to fund students in the private higher education institutions, said Tengku Zafrul.\n\nEducators agree that discounts given to loan borrowers under the budget would reduce the financial burden of parents and spur more students to continue their tertiary education after the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM).\n\nAs noted by National Association of Private Educational Institutions (Napei) secretary-general Dr Teh Choon Jin, such a move would pave the way for underprivileged students to have access to higher education.\n\nTengku Zafrul expressed his hopes that loan borrowers would be more responsible with the repayment of their PTPTN loans.\n\n\u201cPTPTN loan borrowers, you have a responsibility to settle your debts. That is clearly stated when you applied for the loans. It is also in line with religious teachings to pay one\u2019s debts. If not paid, we would be denying other youths from benefiting from the same opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his speech, Tengku Zafrul also noted that the cost-of-living allowance for Majlis Amanah Rakyat (Mara) and PETRONAS scholars will be increased. He said the government would continue to focus on the education of the Bumiputra community, especially those from low-income families.\n\nFuture-proofing education\n\nIt was also announced in Budget 2023 that RM10mil would be set aside to encourage public universities to inculcate green campus initiatives.\n\n\u201cDuring Jelajah Bajet 2023, I had the opportunity to visit photovoltaic solar systems installed by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in 90 locations to supply clean energy on its campus,\u201d Tengku Zafrul said in his speech.\n\nIn addition, more than RM300mil will be provided for upgrading and maintaining public university facilities.\n\nThe budget also looked at improving the digital network of HEIs. With an allocation of RM35mil, the Malaysian Research and Education Network (MYREN) project at public universities, polytechnics, and community colleges will continue to be upgraded in terms of bandwidth capacity.\n\nNoraini said the allocation would be used to improve the green campus initiative in public universities, as well as research and development (R&D) activities.\n\nShe also commended the government\u2019s focus on TVET. According to Noraini, the allocation of RM6.7bil for TVET would help to achieve the target of enabling at least 55% of post-SPM students to further their studies in their respective fields.\n\nThe marketability of graduates was a highlight of Budget 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile the country has achieved full employment, the unemployment rate for those aged 25 years and under, including school-leavers and graduates from HEIs, was at the level of 11% in the second quarter of 2022. This issue will continue to be given due attention,\u201d Tengku Zafrul said.\n\nTo improve youths\u2019 access to employment, the government will provide hiring incentives under the Social Security Organisation (Socso) to employers who hire youths aged between 18 and 30 who have been unemployed for more than three months. In addition, this incentive will be extended to employers who hire TVET graduates.\n\nAlso announced were the Digital Innovation Fund (DIGID) worth RM30mil and the Graduate Entrepreneur Programme (PUSh) worth RM20mil. The former seeks to enhance the employability of 9,000 graduates for careers in the capital market, while PUSh will enable 1,000 graduates to venture into entrepreneurship. These initiatives, Noraini said, showed that the government paid attention to the marketability of graduates.\n\nAs a whole, Noraini said Budget 2023 reflects the government\u2019s care and concern for the higher education sector in the country.\n\n\u201cThrough the distribution of the provisions mentioned (in the budget), it is clear that the education sector, especially higher education, remains the best investment to build a brighter future for students,\u201d she concluded.",
        "SCHOOL-leavers Intan Nasuha Md Noh, Nurul Aishah Mohd Dani and Kaviarusu Linggam had no idea that they were about to have their tertiary studies fully funded by the Higher Education Ministry (MoHE) when they were recently accepted into the highly competitive medical, chemical engineering and electronic engineering courses at three of the country\u2019s public universities.\n\nImagine their elation last month when they received the good news that they were among the first cohort of the Keluarga Malaysia First Child Student Development Programme (SULUNG).\n\nThe new programme is aimed at giving youths in the B40 community a better chance at pursuing a higher education.\n\nHigher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad said the programme aims to provide an opportunity for the first generation in B40 households \u2013 who have yet to see a family member pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher qualification \u2013 to continue their tertiary studies.\n\n\u201cThis programme is especially for B40 students who excel but lack the ability to enter higher education institutions (HEIs),\u201d she said during the SULUNG launch and presentation of the ministry\u2019s sponsorship letters at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) on Oct 26.\n\nShe said SULUNG is a structured development programme designed to grow the potential of selected B40 students to become catalysts for individual and community development.\n\n\u201cThis programme is also in line with the 12th Malaysia Plan\u2019s focus on eradicating extreme poverty and bridging the country\u2019s income gap,\u201d she added.\n\nOn top of things: Noraini speaking at the SULUNG launch and presentation of the ministry\u2019s sponsorship letters at UTHM.\n\nNoraini said she first mooted SULUNG in January, with the idea of benchmarking it against other similar programmes such as the \u201cFirst in Family\u201d in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the \u201cFirst-Generation College Student\u201d in the United States.What makes SULUNG unique, she added, is that successful students are not only given entry into public universities, but they are also offered financial assistance in the form of bursaries covering tuition and various other fees, allowances and laptop assistance.\n\nThe students would also be given hostel accommodation, and counselling by a SULUNG counsellor and an academic adviser if they face any problems in their tertiary journeys. This is to ensure that they can focus on their studies.\u201cWe will also help improve the marketability of these graduates by cooperating with industry so that they will gain access to better job opportunities upon graduation,\u201d she added.\n\nGraduates of the programme would also be allowed to further their studies and become academics at the universities under the ministry.\n\nThis special entry pathway is expected to see B40 candidates taking up 10 per cent of the spots in public universities, polytechnics, community colleges and Public Skills Training Institutes (ILKA).\n\nThe first cohort, comprising 76 students out of 115,477 applicants, began their studies this month.\n\nNoraini said SULUNG is being piloted at eight public universities, namely, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI), Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM), Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) and Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP).\n\nNext year, she said, the programme will be expanded to include the country\u2019s 20 public universities.\u201cThe ministry is also working on obtaining allocations from the government and also funding from outside parties to ensure the sustainability of this programme,\u201d she added.\n\nNoraini also welcomed government-linked universities and private higher education institutions (IPTS) to join hands with the ministry in conducting the programme.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of this programme is based on interest and we hope to extend it not only to all public universities, but also all HEIs nationwide,\u201d she said.\n\nSULUNG selection\n\nStudents cannot apply for the programme. Instead, SULUNG recipients are identified based on a set criteria when they submit their UPUOnline applications.\n\nExcellent students with a CGPA of 3.50 and above must select a competitive course at one of the eight pilot public universities as their first choice.\n\nAnd they must meet the course criteria set by the chosen varsity.\n\nFor now, competitive courses include those in the fields of medicine, dentistry, engineering, law, accounting and business, and Teaching English As A Second Language (TESL) education.\n\nThe varsities will also conduct interviews and conduct checks on the students\u2019 homes and backgrounds to ensure that they are truly deserving of the aid.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, 1,416 students have been identified for the programme through UPUOnline.\n\nNoraini said the success of SULUNG hinges on the ability of these students to have good careers and lift their families out of poverty.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the SULUNG students will be independent after graduation and break the cycle of poverty. We also hope that their success will motivate their other family members and also the local community to strive for success,\u201d she said.\n\nAid for all\n\nDuring the event, Noraini also presented scholarships and sponsorships by the ministry to deserving students.\n\nNoraini said the government had allocated RM150mil this year to sponsor the education of 30,314 Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThe ministry also provides scholarships and financial assistance to target groups that include teaching staff in public institutions and qualified members of the public to further their studies from the certificate level right up to advanced degrees,\u201d she said.The financial aid was for the Bumiputra Academic Training Scheme (SLAB), the IPTA Academic Training Scheme (SLAI), the Sub-Specialty, Post Doctorate and Federal Training Prize (HLP) for teaching staff at public universities, polytechnics and community colleges, and non-academic officers at public universities.For the public, financial assistance was for MyBrain Science (MyBrainSc), the IPT Outstanding Athlete Scholarship, Tokoh Siswa and the Polytechnic Outstanding Student Scholarship.\n\nBesides SULUNG, the underprivileged community benefited from the Basic Financial Aid and Community College Student Financial Aid (BKPKK) and the recently launched B40 TVET Scholarship Programme.\n\nThe ministry also awarded the Financial Assistance for Persons with Disabilities (BKOKU) and the Special Education Programme (PPK) for persons with disabilities (OKU). In addition, a zakat fund contribution of RM12mil was given to all 20 public universities through the Lembaga Tabung Haji\u2019s (LTH) Iqra\u2019 TH programme.\n\n\u201cThis programme is part of LTH\u2019s corporate social responsibility which aims to help poor and asnaf students at universities cover their study costs.\n\n\u201cGod willing, Iqra\u2019 TH will benefit more than 30,000 students,\u201d said Noraini.\n\nDigital access\n\nA total of 50 students from Negri Sembilan, Melaka and Johor were also presented with mobile tablets under the second phase of the PerantiSiswa Keluarga Malaysia initiative.\n\nNoraini said more than 60% of the PerantiSiswa applicants were successful under the second phase of the initiative when applications closed on Sept 30.\n\nAbout 291,000 applications were approved out of the 474,311 received, she said.\n\n\u201cThe ministry expects the distribution of these devices to be completed within two months.

        "KUALA LUMPUR: The government is reinstating the National Higher Education Fund Corp (PTPTN) loan waiver for students who graduate with first-class honours, says the Prime Minister.\n\nThis will again be given to all top students regardless of their socio-economic status, said Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.\n\n\u201cI wish to announce that the government will once again be giving special goodies to any student with a PTPTN loan who has a first-class honours degree, whereby they are allowed to change their loans to be exempted from repayment without taking into account their economic background, race or religion,\u201d he said when launching PTPTN\u2019s 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary celebrations at Matrade Exhibition and Convention Centre yesterday.\n\nHe added that this award would be given to students who graduate in 2019 and onwards.\n\nDuring the announcement of Budget 2019, the exemption was halted for all and given only to students from the B40 families.\n\nIsmail Sabri said he hoped the corporation would discuss with the Finance Ministry regarding the amount needed for this allocation.\n\nOn another matter, he said an Education Savings Club would be launched in schools to teach students better financial literacy.\n\nHe said the PTPTN-created club would also raise awareness about the importance of starting to save for tertiary education early through the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN).\n\nThe Prime Minister said there were currently 13 schools in five states with such a club in their co-curricular module.\n\nIn continuing to deliver the good news, Ismail Sabri said that 3.67 million \u201cMalaysian Family\u201d members managed to further their studies thanks to PTPTN loan disbursements of RM66.87bil to date.\n\n\u201cAt the age of 25 years, PTPTN has become the top tertiary studies savings agency that is committed to shouldering its mandate,\u201d he added.\n\nIsmail Sabri stated that the government had allocated more than RM3bil per year through PTPTN, allowing an average of 180,000 new students to further their tertiary education.\n\nHowever he stressed that repaying the PTPTN loans was important to ensure the sustainability of the fund for future students.\n\nAccording to Ismail Sabri as of June, over two million (82.04%) borrowers had repaid their loans, totalling RM17.8bil.\n\nThe rakyat had expressed concerned about how the loans could be a burden to graduates, he said, adding that to allay those concerns, the government had launched the SSPN savings scheme.\n\n\u201cThe savings scheme has more than RM12.5bil deposited into 5.4 million accounts as of June.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad said with effective, efficient, and innovative management, PTPTN has remained consistent in providing loans for students.\n\n\u201cFrom 1997 to 2002, up to RM5.3bil was allocated by the government for this purpose. From then on, PTPTN no longer depended on the government for the grant,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that although in 2020, the government had postponed repayment for PTPTN loans because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the institution still managed to collect about RM1.35bil.\n\n\u201cLast year, the repayment rate continued to rise, with the debt collection amounting to RM2.36bil. As of June this year, RM1.70bil had been collected, which was about 61% of the targeted RM3bil.\n\n\u201cI believe this achievement was partly due to the introduction of the discount incentive for repayments as a result of the pandemic,\u201d she said, adding that the repayments would be used for the benefit of the next generation, who needed the opportunity to achieve educational success through loan schemes.",

        "PETALING JAYA: DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng must clarify his relationship with the private company that wanted to land the Penang International Airport (PIA) expansion deal, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong.\n\nThe Transport Minister said although the expansion plan for PIA was supposed to have been implemented in 2018, Lim should have considered the role of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which is a government-linked company.\n\n\u201cHowever, once Pakatan formed the government, the costs of the upgrade and expansion were changed to the private financing initiative (PFI) instead.\n\n\u201cWhy did Lim, during his tenure as Finance Minister, choose the PFI model instead of proceeding with the project under MAHB?\u201d asked Dr Wee in a Facebook post yesterday.\n\nHe revealed that on Dec 3, 2018, when Pakatan ruled Putrajaya, a private company allegedly wrote to Lim as the Finance Minister, Anthony Loke as Transport Transport, and Chow Kon Yeow as Penang Chief Minister.\n\n\u201cThis letter made clear that it intended to take over the operation of PIA from MAHB within 30 years.\n\n\u201cFor this, the company said it was prepared to bear the cost of RM1.2bil to expand the airport and raise its passenger capacity to 15 million yearly.\n\n\u201cAt that time, MAHB\u2019s market cap had breached RM15bil, more than enough to bear the cost of PIA\u2019s expansion and upgrades. The private company planned for 15 million yearly passenger capacity, instead of the 12 million when approved under Barisan Nasional.\n\n\u201cWhat this implies is there would be more land acquisition needed, including that of a nearby school.\n\n\u201cWhy had Lim insisted on awarding this project to a private company compared to MAHB, which is already more than capable of financing the project, with the experience to run the facility?\u201d asked Dr Wee.\n\nHe further pointed out that Lim himself praised the initiative to upgrade PIA under Budget 2018.\n\n\u201cLogically, if Pakatan had proceeded with the PIA expansion under Budget 2018 as tabled by the Barisan government, how could I have delayed the project?\n\n\u201cIf the project had been allowed to start in 2018, how would I have postponed it in 2020 when I was Transport Minister?\n\n\u201cBack then, MAHB had a 2018 after-tax profit of RM727.3mil (and RM537mil in 2019), with cash reserves of nearly RM1.5bil, while its market cap was more than RM16bil.\n\n\u201cNot only does MAHB have the reserves to expand PIA, the expenditure could also be offset by the collection of passenger service charges subsequently. How can this former Finance Minister fail to understand this concept?\u201d Dr Wee said, adding that Lim should clarify his relationship with the said private company so that the public could have the full picture.\n\nIn a separate Facebook post, Dr Wee also continued to defend the northern alignment of Section C of ECRL, that starts from Mentakab to Port Klang via Bentong and Gombak, saying that this original proposal meets all the criteria for project sustainability.\n\n\u201cWhen Barisan came in and restarted the project in April 2021, the Transport Ministry and MRL Sdn Bhd, the project owner, held 37 engagement sessions with 17 Selangor state government agencies before we finally decided on the original northern alignment, at the same unit cost, with lower social and environment impact,\u201d said Dr Wee.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the improved northern alignment during my tenure is being kept at RM50.27bil after negotiations with the contractor to bring more benefit to Selangor, especially with the building of many stations (five stations in Selangor) to bring greater economic spillover in Gombak, Serendah and Port Klang, and with extensions all the way to Westport and Northport.\u201d\n\nDr Wee was responding to former Transport Minister Anthony Loke, who claimed in a ceramah in Bentong on Thursday that he wasn\u2019t responsible for switching ECRL\u2019s northern alignment to a southern one that passes near Seremban and Putrajaya.",

        "THE youth and sports fraternity has been waiting with bated breath for who the new minister in charge will be.\n\nNow that Hannah Yeoh has been named for the job, one hopes she will be a competent and dynamic minister to carry the aspirations of the youth in serving out this portfolio.\n\nAfter all, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will have high hopes for her. The Prime Minister himself once served as Culture, Youth and Sports Minister for about a year before moving on to more senior portfolios.\n\nThe Youth and Sports Ministry has always been the training ground for future Prime Ministers with the likes of Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob all having served in the portfolio before.\n\nWhat most people will be hoping is that the new minister in the job will last for at least one term.\n\nWe certainly miss the days when the national sports family could have a go-to minister for a period of five years. The last one to have served a full term was Khairy Jamaluddin from 2013 to 2018.\n\nSince then, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman served from July 2018 to February 2020 when the Sheraton Move felled him. He was replaced by Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican from March 2020 until August 2021 when the Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin government fell.\n\nDatuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu took over only to lose his Tambun seat in the recent elections.\n\nFive years is already a relatively short term when one talks about grooming world beaters or Olympic champions but it should be enough to implement changes or lay out the foundations for new ideas.\n\nBut these three previous ministers hardly had any time to implement policies, much less see the fruits of their work.\n\nSyed Saddiq was the youngest ever minister when he was named to the post but had to deal with the expectations of the Malaysian public after the national contingent failed to secure its target of 70 golds in the 2019 Manila SEA Games. They only managed 56 golds.\n\nReezal Merican took over at a time when the country was facing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and his hands were tied as a result.\n\nHowever, Reezal was a good supporter of sports and initiated the National Sports Vision 2030 while presiding over the contingent\u2019s performance at the Tokyo Olympics, which was delayed by a year because of the pandemic.\n\nThe outgoing minister Ahmad Faizal perhaps had the satisfaction of seeing the nation ending its long wait for a badminton world champion with men\u2019s doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik clinching the title in Tokyo.\n\nFaizal was also in charge when the national football team ended a 42-year wait to qualify for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup finals taking place in Qatar.\n\nTo be fair, much of it was not Faizal\u2019s success \u2013 he just did not do much tinkering with the policies laid in place by his predecessors.\n\nPerhaps what most people involved in the sports fratenity would like to see is for the new appointee to concentrate on strengthening the current policies and not try to create his own legacy, which may backfire.\n\nNew ministers often come in with new ideas but these get shunted aside when someone else takes over.\n\nDatuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein was into extreme sports and Kuala Lumpur hosted the Asian X-Games while Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, who was the first woman Sports Minister, focused on women in sports.\n\nKhairy came up with the Fit Malaysia and National Sports Day while Syed Saddiq went for esports.All these ideas have disappeared along with the ministers. We can assume there could also be a review of the proposal to build drag circuits around the country with RM20mil already allocated under the Budget. Anwar, after all, has expressed his desire to cut down on unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWhat we really need is an entrenched sports policy that everyone who comes in can help to strengthen.\n\nIt will not be fair for the new minister to be answerable for the performance of the contingent at the Asian Games in Hangzhou next year or the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWhat she can do is address the decline of young talent coming through the ranks and how to get the public to be more active.\n\nThere has also been a decline in young talents coming through the schools. Outside of schools, there is a need for more sporting activities and initiatives for the masses which can create a sporting eco-system.\n\nThe big goal is to turn Malaysia into a truly sporting nation \u2013 and to let sports remain as the best unifying tool.",

        "THE recently concluded 15th General Election (GE15) produced a result where no single political party or coalition managed to gain a simple majority of 112 seats in Parliament, hence we had a hung Parliament.\n\nPengerang MP and lawyer Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said yesterday shared an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) to explain what role the anti-hopping law plays post-GE15.\n\nQ What is the next step forward?\n\nAll political parties and coalitions that have secured seats have to attempt to negotiate a post-election coalition government to form a government and identify a prime minister candidate.\n\nQ How to form a post-election coalition government and identify a prime minister candidate?\n\nMPs from the various political parties and coalitions, upon negotiation, have to come together on a bloc basis with another political party and/ or coalition to collectively support the formation of a post-election coalition government and identify a prime minister candidate amongst themselves.\n\nQ What are the means available to ensure MPs from respective political parties coalesce to support the formation of a post-election coalition government and identify a prime minister candidate?\n\nThe anti-hopping law enacted earlier in the year will ensure a coherence of discipline. Under the law, an MP from a political party has to vacate his seat if:\n\na) He resigns as a member of a political party.\n\nb) He ceases to be a member of the political party. The mechanism of cessation of membership of a political party will ensure discipline.\n\nQ How does it do so?\n\nPolitical parties may and have devised a range of internal means to ensure MPs\u2019 adherence to party directives, either through party constitutional amendments or through a set of agreements, to ensure MPs toe the party line on fundamental issues, which would include formation of the government and appointment of the prime minister.\n\nHence, any MP who refuses to toe the party line here will cease to be a member of the political party and have to vacate their seats in Parliament.\n\nQ What means does Barisan Nasional have at its disposal to ensure and maintain party coherence and discipline?\n\nBarisan has developed internal means to manage party discipline, especially amongst elected MPs. Prior to them receiving their watikah and nomination as Barisan candidates, they had signed a series of documents consisting of an offer letter, Statutory Declarations, Candidacy Agreement and an oath.\n\nThe collective implications of all the above mentioned documents are that:\n\na) All elected Barisan MPs have declared that any seats they contested and won belong to Barisan, and\n\nb) The Barisan chairman has the sole prerogative to negotiate the formation of a post-election coalition government.\n\nThe respective Barisan MPs have also undertaken that they will cease to be a member of Barisan if they violate the coalition\u2019s directives in which, under the operations of the anti-hopping law, they will lose their seat in Parliament.\n\nQ Would this not be unconstitutional, for it violates freedom of association?\n\nIt would not be unconstitutional.\n\nIn the process of introducing the anti-hopping law, the lawmakers in the previous Parliament had also amended Article 10 of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe amendment restricts MPs\u2019 freedom of association subjected to the anti-hopping law. The implication here is that an MP is bound by party directive and no longer a \u201cfree agent.\u201d\n\nQ Is it permissible under the anti-hopping law for a party to migrate en bloc from one coalition to another, so any component party in an existing coalition may disagree with their political coalition on a post-election coalition or prime minister candidate and leave?\n\nYes, the anti-hopping law implicitly allows a political party to migrate en bloc from one coalition to another coalition.\n\nHowever, one thing to bear in mind is that the anti-hopping law, in defining a political party, doesn\u2019t differentiate between a political coalition and a component political party.\n\nThe implication here is that if an existing political coalition competed under one logo and presented one manifesto in GE15, and more importantly, if these candidates obtained their watikah to run in GE15 directly from the leader of their respective political coalitions, these coalitions for all intent and purposes are a political party under the anti-hopping law.\n\nThus, any component party which seeks to leave an existing political coalition as described above will have to vacate their seats, for they have defected from a political party.",

They only managed 56 golds.\n\nReezal Merican took over at a time when the country was facing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and his hands were tied as a result.\n\nHowever, Reezal was a good supporter of sports and initiated the National Sports Vision 2030 while presiding over the contingent\u2019s performance at the Tokyo Olympics, which was delayed by a year because of the pandemic.\n\nThe outgoing minister Ahmad Faizal perhaps had the satisfaction of seeing the nation ending its long wait for a badminton world champion with men\u2019s doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik clinching the title in Tokyo.\n\nFaizal was also in charge when the national football team ended a 42-year wait to qualify for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup finals taking place in Qatar.\n\nTo be fair, much of it was not Faizal\u2019s success \u2013 he just did not do much tinkering with the policies laid in place by his predecessors.\n\nPerhaps what most people involved in the sports fratenity would like to see is for the new appointee to concentrate on strengthening the current policies and not try to create his own legacy, which may backfire.\n\nNew ministers often come in with new ideas but these get shunted aside when someone else takes over.\n\nDatuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein was into extreme sports and Kuala Lumpur hosted the Asian X-Games while Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, who was the first woman Sports Minister, focused on women in sports.\n\nKhairy came up with the Fit Malaysia and National Sports Day while Syed Saddiq went for esports.All these ideas have disappeared along with the ministers. We can assume there could also be a review of the proposal to build drag circuits around the country with RM20mil already allocated under the Budget. Anwar, after all, has expressed his desire to cut down on unnecessary expenditure.\n\nWhat we really need is an entrenched sports policy that everyone who comes in can help to strengthen.\n\nIt will not be fair for the new minister to be answerable for the performance of the contingent at the Asian Games in Hangzhou next year or the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWhat she can do is address the decline of young talent coming through the ranks and how to get the public to be more active.\n\nThere has also been a decline in young talents coming through the schools. Outside of schools, there is a need for more sporting activities and initiatives for the masses which can create a sporting eco-system.\n\nThe big goal is to turn Malaysia into a truly sporting nation \u2013 and to let sports remain as the best unifying tool.",

Polling has commenced and that is why the election will continue. If polling had not commenced, the election would be postponed,\u201d Prof Shad Saleem said when contacted.\n\nPakatan Harapan candidate for the Padang Serai parliamentary seat M. Karupaiya, 69, passed away on Wednesday, raising the question of whether polling for the constituency would be postponed.\n\nHowever, a check with the Election Commission\u2019s MySPR Semak portal by voters in the constituency showed a message that the election has been postponed.\n\n\u201cI checked the website and it said: \u2018The 15th general election for P017 Padang Serai has been postponed because of the death of a candidate,\u201d said a voter.\n\nIn GE14, Karupaiya won the seat with a majority of 8,813 votes, defeating PAS candidate Muhamad Sobri Osman and Barisan\u2019s Datuk Dr Leong Yong Kong.\n\nUnder the Elections Act No (6), if an election has been announced and one of the candidates nominated dies or becomes disqualified before the polling had commenced, the Election Commission (EC) can suspend the election in that constituency to enable the affected party to file a fresh nomination.\n\nHowever, as early polling is considered polling too, a source close to EC stated that it was likely that the Padang Serai election would continue with Karupaiya\u2019s name on the ballot paper on polling day.\n\n\u201cOnly after the election results, will EC have to decide whether to call for a by-election,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe EC issued a statement on Wednesday that it would be holding a special meeting on the situation in Padang Serai today.\n\nSeparately, Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said said the Padang Serai election could continue tomorrow without a new date having to be set.The Barisan democracy and law task force head cited Regulation 11 (6) of the Election (Conduct of Elections) Regulations 1981, which states that the EC can only appoint a fresh date before the polls have commenced, whether by early voting or by election day itself.\n\nShe pointed out that early voting had commenced on Nov 7 and Nov 15 for the police and the armed forces as well as their spouses.\n\n\u201cThis has rendered the call for postponement of the election for Padang Serai improbable,\u201d she said.",
        "KUALA LUMPUR: A \"recall remedy\" should be introduced in the Anti Party-Hopping Bill, says Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said.\n\nShe said that a recall remedy - also known as a recall vote - would be able to ensure that leaders have the support of their constituents should they defect from their party after being elected.\n\n\"A recall remedy is seen in several countries as a form of insurance.

        "NIBONG TEBAL: There must be political will to allow citizenship to be automatically conferred to children born to Malaysian mothers with foreign spouses, says Parti Keadilan Rakyat vice-president Nurul Izzah Anwar.\n\nShe said the nation's top executive authorities such as the Attorney General and the Home Minister could help to ease the passage for such a proposal to be tabled in Parliament so that it can be made into a law.\n\nShe added that such a proposal could only be brought to Parliament if the executive allows it to be brought up as an agenda to be debated.\n\n\"We have always been consistent in supporting these rights and we hope it can be made into law.\n\n\"However, at the same time, there must be political will to make it a reality,\" she said at a press conference during a gathering of PKR Wanita at Bandar Cassia here Sunday (Sept 25).\n\nAccording to the state leadership council (MPN), the party's MPs are part of a bipartisan move to enact such a law but insisted that it can only be made if the executive allows it to be tabled in Dewan Rakyat.\n\nIn August, the Court of Appeal held that only children born abroad to Malaysian fathers with foreign spouses are entitled to confer citizenship status on their children born outside Malaysia.\n\nThis means Malaysian women who are married to foreign citizens cannot automatically pass on citizenship status to their children born outside Malaysia.\n\nOn Sept 15, Pengerang MP Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said filed a motion for the tabling of a Private Member's Bill in Parliament for a constitutional amendment in relation to the citizenship of children born abroad to Malaysian mothers.\n\nThe Bill seeks to amend Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution, Clause (1) (b), by inserting the words \"or mother\" after \"father\" and by adding the word \"or mother\" after \"father\" in Clause (1)(c).\n\nFour other MPs, namely Fuziah Salleh (Pakatan Harapan-Kuantan), Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil (PH-Lembah Pantai), Alice Lau (PH-Lanang) and Hannah Yeoh (PH-Segambut), have also submitted similar Bills related to this issue.\n\nA Private Member's Bill on proposed law is submitted by MPs not from the executive branch of government.\n\nOn Aug 29, Azalina said 1.86 million Malaysian women are living overseas, citing reasons including citizenship issues as one of the main factors deterring them from coming back to Malaysia.\n\nThis figure represents 12% of the total female population of 15.6 million in Malaysia.\n\nIn September last year, the High Court ruled that Malaysian women have the same right as Malaysian men to confer automatic citizenship on their overseas-born children.\n\nThe decision was, however, overturned by the Court of Appeal on Aug 5.\n\nIn a majority ruling, the court held that the constitutional provision referred to the biological father and could not be extended to include the mother or parents.\n\nIt was up to Parliament, not the court, to rewrite the Constitution, the judges said.",

Share with voters how they can bring progress, especially to fence-sitters and young voters,\u201d he added.\n\nBarisan Nasional is scheduled to unveil its manifesto today, while Perikatan Nasional and Pakatan Harapan announced their election manifestos on Nov 6 and Nov 2, respectively.\n\nALSO READ: Traders wish campaigners will actually buy something\n\nAmpang Barisan candidate Ivone Low Yi Wen said she did not agree with negative campaigning or attacks on people\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cWe should always promote positive competition. Our voters, especially the young voters, would want to know how youth empowerment can be done.\n\n\u201cThese should be our main focus,\u201d said the Wanita MCA spokesperson and Beliawanis bureau chief.\n\nTenggara Barisan candidate Manndzri Nasib, 42, also agreed that those who run negative campaigns do not have a clear plan and vision for their constituents.\n\nALSO READ: Reject those who play race card\n\n\u201cSome only want to win the elections and will resort to anything to achieve their aim.\n\n\u201cBut the people now know better and will pick the candidates that can provide a clear roadmap for them,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFor Johor Barisan, we have a clear plan, and Insyallah (God willing), we will fulfil our promises as seen in the Johor state elections, where within six months, investment in Johor has increased to about RM60bil and has been ranked among the highest in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPasir Gudang Pakatan candidate Hassan Abdul Karim said that as a candidate, they must always emphasise the interests of the next generation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot destroy our nation and society for our narrow political objectives, which can be destructive to the people and unity.\n\n\u201cI will always advocate conducting a professional and clean campaign, which will help bring about good governance,\u201d he noted.\n\nSenior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs Dr Oh Ei Sun said among the main issues that would come up in the week ahead were socio-economic issues, such as tackling inflation, managing the economy and addressing food shortages.\n\n\u201cHowever, there would still be a fair amount of mudslinging over the next two weeks, with candidates digging out each other\u2019s perhaps not-so-glorious past,\u201d he said.\n\nNational Professors Council senior fellow Dr Jeniri Amir said the Opposition, especially Pakatan, would mainly raise the issue of the high cost of living as there were no other major political issues, such as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), that could affect the perception of voters.\n\n\u201cThey will stick to that as it is hard to raise other issues that can resonate well with voters,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also warned candidates to avoid touching on sensitive issues, such as religion and race, in their campaigns.\n\n\u201cThese are potentially provocative topics that must be completely avoided,\u201d he said.\n\nKangar Pakatan candidate Noor Amin Ahmad said candidates must adhere to international standards on election rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cProfessional and clean campaigns usually stem from good values, rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cSo, it goes without saying that a professional and clean campaign is a sign of a civilised society,\u201d he said.",

        "AL KHOR, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Enner Valencia scored two first-half goals as Ecuador beat hosts Qatar 2-0 in the opening match of the FIFA World Cup on Sunday.\n\nThe Fenerbahce forward converted a penalty before powering home a header to give Gustavo Alfaro's side a perfect start in Group A.\n\nDespite having 47 percent of possession, the hosts didn't manage a single shot on target while Ecuador had three.\n\nThe result marked the first time that a host team has lost the opening game of the World Cup.\n\nThe partisan crowd was sent into stunned silence when Ecuador appeared to take the lead in the fifth minute at Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, around 50 kilometers north of Qatari capital Doha.\n\nValencia powered a header into the back of the net following Felix Torres' overhead kick, but the goal was disallowed after the former West Ham and Everton forward was ruled offside by the video assistant referee.\n\nValencia did not have to wait long for his next chance. The 33-year-old was awarded a penalty in the 15th minute when he was tripped by goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb, having been played through on goal by Sebastian Mendez.\n\nHe then calmly slotted his spot-kick into the bottom right corner after sending Al-Sheeb the wrong way.\n\nEcuador's all-time leading scorer was in inspired form and he doubled the lead just after the half hour by straining every muscle in his neck to thump a header past Al-Sheeb following Angelo Preciado's cross.\n\nQatar's best chance of the opening 45 minutes came moments before the first-half whistle when Almoez Ali sent a glancing header wide of the target connecting Hassan Al-Haydos' cross from the right flank.\n\nEcuador emerged from the interval again looking the more dangerous team in attack. Preciado sent a speculative 25-meter shot over the bar and Al-Sheeb kept out Romario Ibarra's attempt following an errant Bassam Al-Rawi pass.\n\nIt took Qatar until the hour mark to make their first convincing attacking move of the second half. Abdelkarim Hassan sent a dangerous cross into the box from the right wing and Pedro Miguel rose highest only to see his header sail just wide.\n\nScoring chances for both teams were few and far between thereafter as Ecuador were content to sit back and concede possession without ever looking in danger of letting their lead slip.\n\nQatar will face Senegal in their next match on Friday while Ecuador are scheduled to meet the Netherlands the same day.",

        "JOHOR BARU: Attorney General (AG) Tan Sri Idrus Harun should have brought fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho - better known as Jho Low (pic) - back to Malaysia to be tried, says Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim.\n\nHe applauded the decision made by Idris and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in aborting the series of meetings with Low's legal team, saying that it was the right move to make.\n\nHassan said that Low had been charged in courts in Malaysia and the United States for allegedly cheating 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and the government of billions of ringgit.\n\n\u201cHow can there be a bargain between Jho Low and the Malaysian government. Can the justice system in Malaysia be traded for the RM1.5 billion offer from him,\" said Hassan.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday (July 17), Hassan asked if Low is now trying to bribe the Malaysian government.\n\nHassan added that Low should return and face the charges in court if he believes he's innocent, instead of hiding in other countries.\n\nHassan added that with Jho Low appointing the Washington-based law firm Kobre & Kin, which then appointed former Attorney General Tan Sri Apandi Ali as a negotiator, this only acknowledges that Low has committed criminal offences.\n\n\u201cIf Low did nothing wrong, then why is he willing to offer up to RM1.5bil to the Malaysian government in return for all charges against him being dropped,\u201d he said.\n\nHassan also questioned why Apandi became the facilitator between Jho Low and the government as the latter was involved in the 1MDB case.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, it is puzzling to think why Idrus was willing to hold multiple meetings with Jho Low's representatives. Why not reject it from the very beginning,\" said Hassan.\n\nOn Saturday (July 16), the Attorney-General's Chambers said that it had rejected all offers of settlement by Low.\n\n\u201cThe AGC confirms that Jho Low, through his representatives, has made attempts to engage with the government of Malaysia on a settlement this year,\" it said.\n\n\u201cIn these attempts, Jho Low\u2019s representatives met with agencies of the government of Malaysia, including the AGC,\u201d it added in a statement.\n\nThe Edge reported that Jho Low, who is allegedly the mastermind behind the 1MDB scandal, had offered RM1.5bil to the government to settle the charges and that he was represented by Apandi in the negotiations with the government.\n\nApandi, however, said he was merely a facilitator for the international law firm that contacted him to arrange a meeting with the AGC.\n\nThe meeting held at the AGC was attended by Idrus, his officer and a senior officer from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nAsked whether Jho Low was willing to return the money, Apandi said, \u201cIt was so indicated through Kobre & Kim at the meetings\u201d.\n\nHowever, citing confidentiality, he declined to reveal the amount the businessman was looking to return to Malaysia.\n\nOn whether the attempt will be revisited, Apandi said he would not speculate.\n\nJho Low is also facing a US$3.78bil (RM16.8bil) suit filed against him by 1MDB and its four subsidiaries.",

        "PASIR GUDANG: The days of political hatred and personal attacks are gone as the people have become more aware of their needs and what political parties can offer them, says Noor Azleen Ambros.\n\nThe Barisan Nasional candidate for the Pasir Gudang parliamentary seat in the 15th General Election (GE15) said some of the issues that people were most concerned about right now are the increase in the cost of living and children's early education.\n\n\u201cWe have never practised the 'old ways of politics' where we attacked a party based on personal issues, provocation, or strong language and words. I believe that our people are more mature than that.\n\n\u201cOur campaign focus is to share our strengths and what we can offer to the people, besides the changes that we could bring if we managed to form the government after GE15,\u201d he said during a press conference here Saturday (Nov 5).\n\nThe people wanted a representative that could address their concerns at the national level and bring solutions to their troubles, not someone who could only harp on issues, he said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the people in Pasir Gudang are wage earners or operate SMEs, and we hope that we could bring about better days so that the people would continue to prosper.\n\n\u201cThere is concern about a possible recession next year, and with Pasir Gudang being the gateway for the economy in the state through Johor Port and Tanjung Langsat Port, we will be the first to feel the pinch.\n\n\u201cSo the people here need a representative at the federal level so that any issues can be addressed immediately by the federal government,\u201d he said, adding that he also plans to bring in more job opportunities for the locals.\n\nNoor Azleen also shared that 54% of the 198,000 voters in Pasir Gudang are under the age of 40.\n\n\u201cThat is why I wanted to highlight the issues of early education for children. As a father of three myself, it is hard to send our children to a private education centre due to the high cost.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that we will create more childcare centres that have government facilities that could ease the burden for young parents like me,\u201d he explained.\n\nNoor Azleen would be in a four-cornered fight against Pasir Gudang incumbent MP Hassan Abdul Karim from Pakatan Harapan, Muhammad Raffi Beran from Gerakan Tanah Air, and Mohamad Farid Abdul Razak from Perikatan Nasional in GE15.",
        "PASIR GUDANG: Umno vice-president Datuk Seri Khaled Nordin\u2019s name has been submitted as one of the candidates for the Pasir Gudang parliamentary seat in the 15th General Election (GE15).\n\nThe talk is that Khaled prefers the Kota Tinggi parliamentary seat as Umno has a chance of winning it while his old seat Pasir Gudang is difficult to win.\n\nKhaled said Pasir Gudang Umno had sent in his name to contest in the constituency.\n\nHowever, he said this had yet to be finalised, adding that the official process of picking the candidate had just started.\n\n\u201cEach division chief has sent names to the central leadership to be considered as a candidate.\n\n\u201cEach division can send in five or seven names, but so far, there has not been any decision. As of today, the Pasir Gudang division has sent my name,\u201d he said.\n\nKhaled was speaking to reporters after officiating the Umno Pasir Gudang division meeting at the Dewan Serbaguna Taman Mawar here yesterday.\n\nHe said this when asked if he would be contesting in Kota Tinggi, as his posters and banners had already been put up in the district.\n\nKhaled last stood in Pasir Gudang in the 14th General Election in 2018 but lost to PKR\u2019s Hassan Abdul Karim. He also lost the Permas state seat.\n\nAsked if he preferred to contest in Pasir Gudang, Khaled said members of the public should think about the future of their constituency and choose a party that could guarantee good returns in the coming days.\n\nHe said the government should not be under constant threat.\n\nHe drew examples of MPs switching to other parties or \u201cpushing a button\u201d.\n\nHe added that there should be less \u201cpoliticking\u201d, adding that, resources should instead be focused on what can be done to make people\u2019s lives better.\n\n\u201cDo not be swayed by the fear of flooding as spread by the Opposition when we have already been \u2018drowning\u2019 in political instability for the past four years,\u201d said Khaled.\n\nHe pointed out that government agencies such as the National Disaster Management Agency, police, the Health Department, the Fire and Rescue Department, civil defence and volunteers were all well prepared to help victims in case of any emergency, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cUmno will also be there to lend a hand, as we have always been before,\u201d he said.",
        "SHAH ALAM: The prosecution in the Cradle Fund chief executive officer Nazrin Hassan\u2019s murder case failed to establish his exact time of death within the 11.30pm June 13 and 4am June 14, 2018, window that it had stipulated.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution had said the deceased died within that time but his sister\u2019s (Che Elainee) testimony stated he had seen her message at 11.50pm,\u2019\u2019 said the High Court judge, Datuk Ab Karim Ab Rahman.\n\nCLICK TO ENLARGE\n\nThe court also found that the situation at that time did not show that the conduct of the accused, Nazrin\u2019s wife, Samirah Muzzafar, 47, and the two teenagers (now aged 19 and 16), had inflicted injuries which resulted in the death of the victim.\n\nCiting that there were many uncertainties in some of the evidence presented as well as the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove a prima facie case against the accused persons, High Court Judge Datuk Ab Karim Ab Rahman set the trio free yesterday.\n\nHe went on to say that the prosecution had also assumed that Samirah and the two youngsters were at the location of Nazrin\u2019s death at the time of his demise.\n\nAnother uncertainty in the case, according to Justice Ab Karim, was the lack of clarity in regard to the motive behind Nazrin\u2019s alleged murder.\n\nHe said the prosecution had attempted to infer that the alleged murder was motivated by Nazrin\u2019s insurance coverage money, but later in its submission, it (the prosecution) had stated that the motive in the case was not clear.\n\nIn addition, Justice Ab Karim also held that there were attempts by the prosecution to implicate Samirah in the alleged murder case with allegations that she did not alert the fire and rescue department (after the bedroom where Nazrin was caught fire) or that she did not appear saddened over her husband\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHer actions were merely the prosecution\u2019s perception,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe trio and the family\u2019s Indonesian helper, Eka Wahyu Lestari, who is still at large, were charged with Nazrin\u2019s murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code in 2018. Hearing commenced on Sept 6, 2019.\n\nThe boys were aged 15 and 11 at the time of the incident.\n\nThey were accused of allegedly committing the offence at the deceased\u2019s home in Mutiara Damansara, Petaling Jaya, between 11.30pm and 4am the following day on June 13, 2018.\n\nLater that day, as he was leaving the Shah Alam court complex, lead defence counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said his team was well prepared should the prosecution file an appeal.\n\n\u201cFor me, if there is an appeal by the prosecution, I think we are given another opportunity to prove the ingredients or the essence of this charge that can be set aside in this court.\n\n\u201cSo, we stand to win, assuming there is an appeal. Because I think the decision will be maintained,\u201d Muhammad Shafee.\n\nOn Justice Ab Karim\u2019s contention that the prosecution had failed to determine Nazrin\u2019s exact time of death, Muhammad Shafee said: \u201cThe prosecution mentioned between 11.30pm on June 13 till 4.30am the next day.\n\n\u201cSo, the judge, when announcing his decision based on the witness testimony of Dr Siew Sheue Feng, (said) that the incident took place between 11am and 1pm on June 14, 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is out(side) of the alleged time that was made during the charge,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a reliable source, the prosecution will refer the matter to the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers for the next course of action, which includes whether or not to appeal against Justice Ab Karim\u2019s decision.\n\nBesides Muhammad Shafee, others in the defence team were Rahmat Hazlan, LS Leonard, S. Suresh, Savreena Kaur and Zahria Eleena Redza, whilst the DPPs in attendance were Mohd Asnawi Abu Hanipah, Tengku Intan Suraya Tengku Ismail and Nur Sabrina Zubairi.",
        "When art collector Nik M. Fahmee was forced to stay home during the pandemic, he spent a lot of time staring at his walls.\n\nIt is a good thing these walls \u2013 and many other surfaces in his house in Selangor \u2013 are not bare. With paintings in every room, he had plenty to look at and lots of time to think.\n\nHe reminisced about the past, about living and joy and grief. He reflected on his childhood and what raising a family means to him.\n\nAn image in a painting might spark a memory \u2013 of a marriage proposal, a happy decision or a difficult conversation with a loved one.\n\n\u201cI thought about my journey of art collection and the relationships I have built. And then I wrote about these things, at first daily, and when restrictions were lifted, weekly,\u201d he says during a recent interview.\n\nFadilah Karim\u2019s colour pencil sketches transported him back to his school days, where in retaliation to a friend slapping him, he snipped off her ponytail with a pair of scissors and flung it out the moving school bus window.\n\nNik Fahmee\u2019s \u2018Ginger Biscuits\u2019 book, which is his personal and poignant collection of stories and selected artworks by Malaysian artists. Photo: Blue Monkey Press\n\nA still life by Ahmad Zakii Anwar, featuring a papaya, reminded Nik of his late grandfather who loved this fruit.\n\n\u201cHe loved his papayas. He would have it after almost every meal. He especially liked them chilled. He passed on when I was 10 years old. I remember the phone on the piano ringing, and my father answering the call, then my mother came to him and hugged him and they both cried. My mother was the eldest daughter. She stopped cutting and eating papayas for a long time. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to. Such is grief,\u201d he wrote in one of his stories.\n\nAn oil painting of a goldfish by Samsudin Wahab brought to mind how a young Nik caused chaos at a wedding when he hungrily gobbled the goldfish-shaped bahulu (traditional Malay pastry) meant as a wedding hantaran (part of a wedding dowry).\n\n\u201cEveryone was staring at me. Who knew the goldfish\u2019s head would come off so easily! My mother lunged forward, apologised profusely, and yanked me out. Once in the car, she gave me the biggest and longest cubit geram (pinch) ever bestowed upon any child in the world. I was known as the \u2018Budak Makan Hantaran Kepala Bahalu Ikan Mas\u2019 for a while. I was a legend,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018One guy wrote to me, saying that he doesn\u2019t know me and he doesn\u2019t know art, but he loves the stories. Another woman, who knows the art world, told me that she felt like giving me a hug after she read the book,\u2019 says Nik Fahmee, author of \u2018Ginger Biscuits\u2019. Photo: Saiful Chin\n\nHe shared these stories on Instagram, an account he keeps private till this day.\n\nHe has built his art collection \u2013 which he displays in his home \u2013 for almost two decades, adding pieces whenever he comes across something that speaks to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy a painting or sculpture unless it resonates with me. Every artwork in my house has some meaning to me. With one or two exceptions, like an artwork by a Filipino artist who is a relative, all the works are by Malaysian artists. I like supporting the local art scene and I also like how accessible it is to meet these artists and get to know them a bit better,\u201d says Nik.\n\nThe book idea\n\nWhen he posted his stories online, people told him how much they liked them. There were hundreds of stories, written over a span of over a year.\n\nThen they started asking for a book, and Ginger Biscuits was born.\n\n\u201cWhen I started this project during the MCO (movement control order), I never thought I would ever be compiling it into a book. I was just writing for fun at home, right? When I was compiling the stories, selecting which ones would make it into the book, I told my wife that these are really personal tales, so it feels like kind of an expose, you know? But I was turning 50 this year, so I thought what the heck, just do it,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nA view of the Nik M. Fahmee's 'Ginger Biscuits' book\u2019s interior, featuring a line-up handpicked Malaysian art and the author's personal stories. Photo: Handout\n\nGinger Biscuits is self-published, a passion project that has reached out to readers beyond Nik\u2019s Instagram followers, since its release a few weeks ago.\n\nFifty stories made the cut, with each story accompanied by an image of the corresponding artwork.\n\nFor instance, there is a red teapot painting by Fauzulyusri featured here, a work that transported Nik back to his childhood where a \u201cterrifyingly garang (fierce) teacher\u201d from school came to have tea with his mother every week.\n\n\u201cWho in the whole wide world would want their teacher coming to their home for tea? I tried to persuade my mother to end her unnecessary, ridiculous and traumatising friendship with my teacher. But of course, my mother being my mother, never listened to me,\u201d he wrote in Tea At Home.\n\nThe stories here are lively, heartfelt and easy to read. They range from childhood stories to observations of the world around him and conversations with artists.\n\nAn exhibition of the artworks featured in the book 'Ginger Biscuits' was held last month at Cult Gallery in Kuala Lumpur. Photo: Saiful Chin\n\n\u201cSeveral people have told me that they read it in one sitting. One guy wrote to me, saying that he doesn\u2019t know me and he doesn\u2019t know art, but he loves the stories.\n\n\"Another woman, who knows the art world, told me that she felt like giving me a hug after she read the book. I never intended to make any money from this book, but it has been very rewarding in other ways. I am blessed because I am able to connect the artworks I love with the stories of my life, the people I meet and the things I do,\u201d he says.\n\nNik also sees this book as an attempt to leave behind stories for his children and the younger generation.\n\nHe used to listen to the elders in his family tell stories of their childhood and considers it a pity that these were never recorded.\n\nHisyamuddin Abdullah\u2019s \u2018Suara Tak Didengar\u2019 (acrylic on canvas, 2021), an artwork that captures the politics of the nation in an unintentional way, writes Fahmee in his book.\n\nThis storytelling project is an effort to document some of his thoughts and love for art.\n\nIn Ginger Biscuits, he has penned a story about each of his four children. At the recent launch of the book at Cult Gallery in Kuala Lumpur, he got them to read these stories.\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed watching them read the stories I wrote about them. During the MCO, we walked around the house together and I got them to pick their favourite artworks. They all have very different personalities and it reflects in their artwork choice as well as their observations and opinion about the art.\n\n\"I wanted to go deeper into my kids\u2019 minds and understand why they like these works. A good artwork will stop you in your tracks, it will make you feel and think.

Even with this amount of spending, flash floods are getting worse around Johor Baru,\u201d he said in a statement on Monday (Sept 26).\n\nLiew also urged the government to explain every expenditure that had been made to overcome the flood issue as the people have the right to more information regarding the latest development.\n\nHe said that he had suggested during the state assembly meeting in June to set up a bipartisan committee on climate change and urban planning to find long-term solutions and draw up an effective flood and climate action plan.\n\n\u201cEveryone needs to accept the fact that climate change is happening all over the world and cannot escape its impact.\n\n\u201cAll old calculations are no longer relevant. Rainfall that is said to occur only once in 100 years is no longer valid in the current context.\n\n\u201cLeadership and coordination from the state government level is very necessary where they should not expect the work at the local council level to be sufficient without comprehensive coordination,\u201d he added.",

        "The Public Accounts Committee report regarding the procurement of six littoral combat ships (LCS) has once again driven Malaysia\u2019s politics into a frenzy and also into the global spotlight.\n\nIn the latest development, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the Cabinet has called for the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to speed up investigations into the LCS scandal, and if strong evidence is obtained, the Attorney General should proceed to charge the individuals responsible in court.\n\nMCA welcomes this announcement, and hopes that no stone will be left unturned because Malaysians nationwide are awaiting the truth. Furthermore, considering that national assets are involved, MCA hopes that no double standards will be practised; whoever was responsible must be charged accordingly regardless of background and social status.\n\nBesides that, those who openly slander others regarding the LCS scandal should also be punished according to the provisions under the Penal Code. This is because fake news can sometimes escalate into fights and cause people to turn against each other.\n\nNevertheless, it is strange how Pakatan Harapan leaders are wildly accusing the government even though back in October 2018, it was Pakatan\u2019s former deputy defence minister Liew Chin Tong himself who attended the keel laying ceremony for the fourth Royal Malaysian Navy LCS.\n\nIt is impossible for YB Liew Chin Tong to be oblivious.

        "MUAR: Rumblings among the DAP grassroots and even some NGOs are growing louder over a \u201cpurge\u201d in the party which will likely see four incumbents being dropped while two others have announced their retirement.\n\nMany in the party claim that those who have served their constituents well all these years should not be removed at this juncture. Instead, they felt the party should work to unite everyone, even those from different camps.\n\nAmong those touted to be dropped or moved include Tan Hong Pin (Skudai), S. Ramakrishnan (Bekok), Cheo Yee How (Perling), Yeo Tung Siong (Pekan Nanas) and Ng Yak Howe (Bentayan).\n\nTwo incumbents, Chew Peck Choo (Yong Peng) and Tan Chen Choon (Jementah), have announced that they will be retiring.\n\nSo far, DAP has announced four incumbents to contest in the Johor election, namely in Paloh, Tangkak, Mengkibol and Penggaram.\n\nThe four are aligned to either state chief Liew Chin Tong or his deputy Teo Nie Ching or Bakri MP Yeo Bee Yin.\n\nParty sources said the \u201cpurge\u201d in Johor DAP started in 2018 when Hong Pin challenged Liew for the state chairmanship and lost by a few votes. In 2021, Hong Pin lost again and did not even make the cut into the state line-up.\n\nTalk has been rife that Senai incumbent Tee Bong Tsong could be moved to Yong Peng.\n\n\u201cWe are also hearing that Teo herself may contest a state seat as part of the succession effort, to take over the state leadership from Liew,\u201d the sources said, adding that among DAP\u2019s safest seats included Skudai, Bentayan and Senai.\n\nThey said Senai would be a convenient seat for Teo, as it was within her Kulai parliamentary seat.\n\nParty leaders, including secretary-general Lim Guan Eng, have brushed off the rumblings.\n\nThe sources said there is a possibility of some candidates being moved to other seats because of seat negotiations with Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda).\n\n\u201cAnyway, none of those being dropped or moved have been involved in any scandal or abuse of power or have failed to perform,\u201d the sources said.\n\nHong Pin, when contacted, said Liew had to explain why he was dropped as he had not been implicated in any scandal or issues before and had served the party and constituents well.\n\n\u201cSo far, three incumbents including me have been told about being dropped.

We have to bring about change!\u201d said Chua.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in Accounting and Finance, he joined MCA as he believes that \u201cif you want to change the country, you have to do it from inside\u201d.\n\nChua is the Barisan Nasional candidate for the Kulai parliamentary seat. The 29-year-old recently quit his post as special officer to Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi.\n\nIn a September visit to Kulai, MCA president Dr Wee Ka Siong said that he was impressed by the candidate\u2019s track record and commitment to help people, highlighting that Chua as deputy chief of MCA\u2019s complaints and public services bureau has helped many victims of Ah Long despite the repeated threats to him and his family.\n\nIn recalling an incident last year, Chua said he rushed home to find red paint splashed on his house walls and gate.\n\nOn the same day, he received a gun with this chilling message: Choose. Your life or we burn your house down! \u201cAll these challenges just make me more determined to charge on with my political work,\u201d said Chua, who is active in the Iskandar Malaysia Youth Council and several Chinese associations.\n\nOver the years, he has organised community brigades made up of local youths to help flood victims, sanitise houses of Covid 19-hit residents and supply food aid to desperate families. They even came up to help Shah Alam flood victims in their time of need.\n\nFor Chua, who went to the Foon Yew Chinese independent high school in Johor, local issues to be addressed include floods, traffic jams, poor road conditions and the high cost of living.\n\nHigh on his agenda is to create more jobs to halt the drain of young talents to Singapore.\n\nChua agrees that helping MCA to reclaim the Kulai constituency is a formidable task, as he is taking on a very strong candidate from Pakatan Harapan.\n\nFor the past two terms, DAP\u2019s national publicity chief Teo Nie Ching has been the MP for Kulai. She served as deputy Education Minister from July 2018 until the Pakatan government was toppled in February 2020. Chua will also face Perikatan Nasional\u2019s Tan Chin Hok (Gerakan) this season.\n\nBut to Chua, nothing is impossible in politics. He knows his devotion and his work would have made an impression on a segment of the 151,000 voters (51% Malays, 38% Chinese and 10% Indians).\n\nIf the crowd who stopped to listen to him at his \u201cpop up\u201d ceramah at Kopitiam Tong Nam in Bandar Indahpura here on the night of Nomination Day last Saturday is any indication, Chua is gaining approval for his politics, community work and convictions.\n\n\u201cKulai is a kawasan hitam (unwinnable area) for MCA.

        "OVER the years, the once quiet Kulai has turned into one of the busiest districts in Johor with many new businesses popping up to capitalise on its proximity to Singapore.\n\nThe district was previously known as \u201cgui lai\u201d in the early 1920s, which means \u201cthe arrival of tortoise\u201d in Mandarin.\n\nIt is said the district was often hit by floods during the rainy season in the past and this resulted in many tortoises coming out of the rivers. From gui lai, the name changed to Kulai.\n\nThe Kulai parliamentary constituency encompasses three state seats, namely Bukit Batu, Bukit Permai and Senai.\n\nIt is home to several Felda settlements, including the earliest one in Johor \u2013 Felda Taib Andak.\n\nLocated about 30km from Johor Baru, Kulai is home to Johor Premium Outlet and Senai International Airport.\n\nThe district is seen as an important investment hub with the development of the Sedenak Tech Park (STeP), which is expected to be fully operational by 2023.\n\nAs of July this year, this high-tech industrial hub, formerly known as the Kulai Iskandar Data Exchange (Kidex), has accumulated RM12.5bil worth of investments.\n\nHowever, locals feel that more can be done to increase development while improving the quality of life of people living here.\n\nMuhammad Aminul Hafiz: Kulai plagued by flash floods.\n\nCashier Muhammad Aminul Hafiz Sharulanuar, 21, said the district was still plagued by flash floods.\n\n\u201cImproving the irrigation and drainage systems should be top on the list.\n\n\u201cThe road leading toward the town area at Persiaran Indahpura Utama is often inundated after heavy rain,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is also worried about poorly lit roads with potholes.\n\n\u201cI almost got into an accident while riding my motorcycle near the bus terminal as the road was dark and there was a pothole.\u201d\n\nMechanic Chen Fun Ching, 36, said that one of the problems faced by businesses here was the lack of manpower because many locals opted to work across the border.\n\nChen: Businesses in Kulai face lack of manpower.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of job opportunities in Kulai but the salary is significantly lower compared to what Singapore can offer because of the better exchange rate.\n\n\u201cMost young people prefer to look for jobs in Singapore, leaving businesses here with no workers.\n\n\u201cThe problem has become more acute after the border with Singapore reopened,\u201d he added.\n\nChen, who lives in Kampung Seelong, said there was also unequal development between the town and rural areas in the district.\n\n\u201cAllocation for development should be equal across all of Kulai.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair to only focus on the town area as people in rural areas will be left behind.\u201d\n\nIntern V. Nishantini, 24, said public amenities in Kulai needed to be improved to cater to the increased population.\n\n\u201cMore people have been making Kulai their home and this is evident in the heavy traffic congestion we face on a daily basis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA majority of those working in Singapore live in Kulai as it is close to the border.\n\n\u201cSo not only is there a need to improve public amenities but also increase the number of government clinics, hospitals and schools,\u201d she added.\n\nThe majority of Kulai\u2019s 150,000 registered voters are Chinese at 53%, while 35% are Malay and 12% Indian.\n\nNishantini: Improve amenities as population increasing.\n\nIn the 14th General Election, DAP\u2019s Teo Nie Ching, who is also a former deputy minister, won the seat in a three-corner fight.\n\nShe gained a 32,748 majority against MCA\u2019s Tang Nai Soon and Juwahir Amin from PAS.\n\nWhen contacted, Johor MCA Youth chief Ling Tian Soon said the party hoped to wrest the seat from DAP, given its good service record.\n\n\u201cWe plan to field a young candidate as there are many young voters in the constituency.\n\n\u201cAs the state MCA Youth chief, I will ensure that we help the candidate get back this seat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that in the March state election, eight out of the 15 seats were contested by the party\u2019s youth wing.\n\n\u201cJohor MCA Youth has many people with good potential and we welcome the party\u2019s decision to field candidates from the wing in GE15,\u201d said Ling.",

Two others have been left hanging.\n\n\u201cIf he (Liew) is dropping incumbents merely to get rid of those from other factions, this is not right,\u201d he said, adding that DAP\u2019s strategy should be to retain those who have served the people well.\n\nHe said with the strict SOP during Covid-19, people would not even know who the new faces are from DAP.\n\nAsked if he would leave the party if dropped, he said he joined DAP to serve and would continue.\n\nMeanwhile, Johor Indian Business Association president P. Sivakumar said Ramakrishan had served his constituents well in Bekok and also as a state executive councillor when Pakatan Harapan was the government.\n\n\u201cWhy drop him after one term?\u201d Sivakumar asked, adding that DAP, being a multiracial party, should allocate at least three seats each for Indian and Malay candidates.",

        "KOTA MARUDU: It is a \"bergigit-gigit\" race in Sabah\u2019s northern Kota Marudu where it will see two local heavyweight candidates facing off against each other.\n\nSix candidates are battling for the seat here but locals see that the actual fight is between veteran leader Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Ongkili (GRS-Barisan) and influential local politician Datuk Wetrom Bahanda (Parti KDM).\n\n\"Bergigit\" in the local Sabah slang, loosely means at each other\u2019s throats or being neck-and-neck in a stiff competition.\n\nOngkili, who is seeking to retain the seat for a seventh consecutive term, is putting up a tough fight in his defence of the constituency which has been dubbed as one of the poorest districts in the country.\n\nThe Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president was earlier speculated to have a difficult time to stave off Wetrom whose influence had steadily grown after winning the Bandau state seat in the 2020 Sabah snap polls.\n\nWhen you drive around Kota Marudu, which is more than twice the size of Perlis at 1,917km sq, it is obvious Wetrom, who is making his parliamentary election debut, has won the poster wars.\n\nWetrom\u2019s banners and the KDM flags somewhat outnumber his GRS rival roughly by 2:1, not to mention the other four candidates vying for the seat.\n\nHowever, the KDM deputy president must not be too comfortable as the GRS-Barisan components were also backing up Ongkili, who was at mid-way point and is seen as being able to turn around the campaign in his favour.\n\nOn Saturday (Nov 12), Ongkili flew in with PBS vice-president Hendrus Anding in a helicopter to Kampung Gana, an agropolitan village deep in Kota Marudu which is about 40km uphill, to canvass for support from the 1,114 voters in the area.\n\nThe village, which actually comprises 10 villages, was seen as a vital area, which Wetrom was also keen to conquer in his quest to unseat Ongkili.\n\n\"We leave it to the electorate to decide. We\u2019re sincere about becoming a vessel for the development of the area here,\" Ongkili said when asked about the public opinion on his capability to still be able to lead the constituency.\n\nHe added that throughout his terms in Kota Marudu, he had brought in developments in terms of providing basic necessary infrastructure such as roads and building schools in the villages here.\n\n\"These are the developments (that I\u2019ve brought), which didn\u2019t come by chance. It involved proper planning and working closely with the civil servants.\n\n\"If you put Kota Marudu alongside other districts, I think we\u2019ve been doing very well,\" he told reporters after his speech here on Saturday (Nov 12).\n\nMohd Nazmi Umbit said the people in Kampung Sonsogon-Paliu, one of the villages in Kampung Gana, had never been let down by Wetrom so far, more so after he was elected as the Bandau assemblyman.\n\n\"When there is difficulty such as someone passing or for example just recently, there was a fire in a village here, he will not hesitate to give assistance.\n\n\"He also gives donations to the surau here and when we call, he will even come in person to our remote village.\n\n\u201cHe is a Kota Marudu native and he knows the problems faced by the people here,\u201d said the 48-year-old farmer, adding they felt Ongkili had failed to resolve various issues including completion of housing for the hardcore poor people despite his long service as the MP.\n\n\"He (Ongkili) is also rarely seen here,\" Nazmi claimed, adding that \"today was the first time I saw him after a while and he came in a chopper. Sometimes, you just want to feel your leaders as one of the villagers\u201d.\n\nBut not everyone was convinced that Wetrom was the answer to their woes as Wong Sui Ming, another resident at Gana, would attest.\n\n\u201cHe is seen as a turncoat. On the other hand, Ongkili is seen as a consistent leader who has helped the community for so many years,\" he said.\n\nWhile appreciating the development brought in by Ongkili, youths in Kampung Gana also desired more job opportunities in the area.\n\nRainon Ining, 32, said as the population of the village grew, more youths had to venture out to earn a living as there were not enough jobs in the village and the town.\n\n\"Ongkili is doing well as he brought in a lot of developments. However, at the same time we need more, especially for the youths.\n\n\"We have youths who had to travel to the cities to find jobs such as to the peninsula and even overseas, in Japan.\n\n\"They work in the manufacturing line. We want more job opportunities here, probably by turning Kampung Gana into a tourist attraction as well. We have a lot to offer to the tourists,\" the father of two said.\n\nThe civil servant said the majority of the locals here work in the plantation sectors, which the youths have less interest in.\n\nOngkili\u2019s chances of retaining the seat have also been bumped up after division heads from other GRS component parties such as Sabah STAR and Sabah Bersatu seemed to have rallied behind the veteran state leader.\n\nAmong those backing him was his former nemesis Datuk Maijol Mahap who had contested against Ongkili thrice before for the seat.\n\nMahap, who is now the Kota Marudu Bersatu information chief, stood as a Parti Harapan Rakyat Sabah candidate in the last general polls and was Ongkili\u2019s closest contender, losing by only 1,774 votes after garnering 11,259 ballots against the latter\u2019s 13,033.",

How to balance between the two would test his leadership vigour,\u201d he added.\n\nOne unhappy customer with the seat negotiations within GRS so far would seem to be Bandau assemblyman Datuk Wetrom Bahanda who is said to be eyeing the Kota Marudu parliamentary seat, which is traditionally allocated PBS.\n\nWetrom has since fallen out with GRS over the snub, and has reportedly been willing to join Parti Warisan or the Datuk Peter Anthony-led Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (KDM) in order for him to contest the Kota Marudu seat in GE15.\n\nFollowing this, there was talk that other GRS leaders would follow suit if they were not considered as candidates although the names speculated have denied the claim.\n\nOh said he would not be surprised if there were more unnerved in GRS\u2019 direction if they do not get their way in GE15.\n\n\u201cDifferent Adun (assemblymen) see different political prospects at different times, and some may not be happy with their existing parties.\n\n\u201cSo, it has become a norm for Sabah ADUNs to switch sides as they see fit for their political interests,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in the end, he believed that although local party leaders will \u201cmake a lot of noises\u201d if their demands were not met, they will in the end concede and come back to singing the same tune.\n\n\u201cWell, what could they do besides biting the bullet?,\u201d he said.\n\nGRS was initially created as a loose coalition that included Sabah Barisan to topple the Parti Warisan-led state government in the 2020 snap state election.\n\nAfter winning the Sabah election, GRS was later registered as an official party in March this year, although Sabah Barisan refused to become part of the formal pact.\n\nThat led to the state administration to be known as the GRS-Barisan state government.\n\nGRS was then officially launched last May, with the aim of providing a platform to unite local parties in order to boost the value and meaning of their struggles in the local and national political arena.",

        "Most Tunisian schools are cash-strapped and run down, but an innovative project has allowed one to become self-sustaining by generating its own solar power and growing its own food.\n\nToday, the man behind the initiative hopes the success of the rural Makthar boarding school can serve as a model to improve the crumbling public school sector in the small North African nation.\n\nEntrepreneur Lotfi Hamadi, 46, founder of the \"Wallah (Swear to God) We Can\" non-profit group, grew up in France but moved to Tunisia after the 2011 revolution that overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nBased in Tunis, the hospitality consultant set his sights on the school, located in a remote and poor region 170km (100 miles) southwest of the capital and close to his parents' hometown of Kesra.\n\n\"I wanted to take what works in the business world and turn schools into social enterprises,\" said Hamadi, whose parents were economic migrants to France who could not read or write.\n\n\"We're not trying to fill the gap left by the education system but to compensate them a bit, teach them to learn, give them the curiosity to open up to the world,\" he said about the school's 565 students, most of whom are boarders.\n\nHamadi started a decade ago by gathering donations to buy 50 solar water heaters \u2013 allowing regular hot showers for the students for the first time \u2013 and 140 photovoltaic panels that produce four times the power consumed on site.\n\nBy selling one-third of the surplus back to the national power company, the school could pay back debts to utilities and fund site improvements and extra-curricular activities.\n\nThe remaining extra power is distributed for free to three other nearby schools.\n\nLast year, Hamadi's group launched Kidchen, a farmers' cooperative that grows vegetables on around eight hectares (20 acres) of nearby land.\n\nWhile some produce goes to the school canteen, 90% has been sold since this summer, with the profits helping to pay for school activities.\n\nKidchen is staffed by six school parents, formerly unemployed, and an agricultural engineer, who receive stable incomes and a share of the equity and dividends.\n\n\"That pushes us to work harder and produce more,\" said chief gardener Chayeb Chayeb, a 44-year-old father of three.\n\n\"It's a project for ourselves.\"\n\nDiscovering opportunities\n\nHamadi said better schooling is urgently needed in the country gripped by years of political instability and economic woes since the revolution.\n\nThe situation now is a far cry from the era of Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia's first president after independence from France in 1956, who strongly promoted primary education.\n\nInitially the Arab Spring uprising inspired hopes of greater social and economic rights, but today \"75% of pupils leave primary school without being able to write two sentences\", Hamadi said.\n\n\"The education system has been suffering since the revolution... because every government has caved in to pressure from the unions,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, over 95% of the ministry's budget goes to paying staff salaries, leaving little for maintenance, schoolbooks and teacher training.\n\nSome 100,000 pupils drop out of the Tunisian school system every year, and many parents, worried about low academic standards in state schools, opt for expensive private tuition.\n\nChayeb said the Makthar model had helped his family and given his children better school meals and activities ranging from business skills and foreign languages to robotics and drama.\n\n\"Before, I was a seasonal worker on five- or six-month contracts, always somewhere different,\" he said. \"Now I work near where I live.\"\n\nFormer student Chaima Rhouma, 21 and studying law with a view to becoming a diplomat, said the project had completely revitalised the school, replacing a garbage-strewn yard with a sports field and garden.\n\nLiterature, theatre and cinema clubs had filled her with \"good vibes\", she said. \"I've become more curious, I'm always looking for new things. Here you can study by having fun.\"\n\nThe school has gained a reputation in the region and is in high demand, with 80 children now on the waiting list, said its director Taher Meterfi.\n\nHamadi is meanwhile forging ahead with his next project \u2013 a largely organic 40ha farm project to supply the city's 23 schools with energy and food for some 3,500 students.\n\nAt a time when Tunisia's crisis is driving many young people to emigrate, he hopes to help children \"come to terms with their country and discover the opportunities it has to offer them\". \u2013 AFP",

        "A controversial appointment almost eclipses Anwar\u2019s maiden Cabinet but it is generally a line-up of younger and fresher faces.\n\nTHE most asked question in the last one week has finally been answered.\n\nAnd the answer is: Yes, Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is once again Deputy Prime Minister alongside Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).\n\nThe man responsible for Barisan Nasional throwing its support behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has made a grand but controversial return to the office he occupied from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIt is the mother of all ironies that Ahmad Zahid has gone from zero to hero among Pakatan Harapan supporters. They know that without him, Anwar would not be where he is.\n\nIt has not been easy for Anwar to accommodate the demands of his new partners.\n\nBarisan felt it deserved portfolios that befit its role as kingmaker while GPS had its own Sarawak-centric priorities.\n\nAnwar promised a lean Cabinet but the end result was anything but lean.\n\nThere are a total of 25 ministers with another three portfolios held by the Prime Minister and the two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nIt is only slightly less crowded than the previous 33-person Cabinet.\n\nThe most interesting part of Anwar\u2019s Cabinet was in the economic appointments.\n\nThe Prime Minister, whose top priority is economic recovery, is also Finance Minister.\n\nFormer Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Hassan Marican has been roped in as an economic adviser because the reputed technocrat can help inject investor confidence.\n\nPandan MP Rafizi Ramli, whose supporters wanted him for the finance post, is Economy Minister.\n\nThe odd man out in the economic box is International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz who was certainly not in Anwar\u2019s shortlist of candidates.\n\nThis is the second time that Tengku Zafrul, who lost in Kuala Selangor in the recent elections, is making a back door entry into the Cabinet.\n\nIt is a rather mixed bag of personalities that has been entrusted to revive the economy.\n\nThe same could be said for the general line-up, too.\n\n\u201cIt is a line-up of younger and fresher faces especially those from PKR. They will bring down the average age of the Cabinet, making it the youngest Cabinet we\u2019ve had in a long while,\u201d said political commentator Khaw Veon Szu.\n\nIt is also no coincidence that most of the ministers are Malays and Bumiputera.\n\nAnwar understands the power of optics, especially given that the opposition bench is almost entirely Malay and Muslim.\n\nA total of 15 portfolios went to Pakatan with PKR taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nSome think the political animal in Anwar is moving to strengthen his party.\n\nBut the fact is that PKR is a genuinely multiracial party, its leaders are well-educated, they do not harp on race and religion and they represent a Malaysia that many of us want to see.\n\nThose appointed are there on their own merit.\n\nWas it a strategic move for DAP to accept only four ministerships? Was it to puncture accusations that DAP dominates the government?\n\nDAP\u2019s portfolios \u2013 Transport, Local Government, Youth and Sports and Human Resources \u2013 are important and will enable the party to reach out to its base.\n\nIts Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo was said to have declined a seat in the Cabinet.\n\nAnwar\u2019s other concern is to ensure that his government survives a full term and that means keeping his partners contented so they do not get up to any mischief.\n\nBoth Barisan and GPS got almost equal treatment although Ahmad Zahid was obviously the big winner, landing the Rural Development portfolio. It is a coveted ministry because of its outreach to the Malay heartland.\n\nBut some things are not meant to be and Rembau MP Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who many thought would be the Deputy Prime Minister, ended up in Defence.\n\nAnwar has eased into the job quite smoothly, be it the outpouring of support and attention wherever he goes to audiences at the palace.\n\nAnyone else would have been overwhelmed by the sudden transition from Opposition leader to Prime Minister.\n\nHe has also set several admirable dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 open tenders for projects, no new official car, no unnecessary renovations to his office, no gifts and no salary for himself.\n\nThe air is still filled with euphoria over the rise of Anwar and it has been quite comical and sad too to watch Pakatan supporters fall over themselves trying to justify partnering with Umno and downplaying corruption issues.\n\nSome call it pragmatism. Others say it is for the sake of stability.\n\nActually, it is Machiavellian politics at its best where the end justifies the means.\n\nBut nobody wants to see more political instability and that is why Anwar should get a chance to do his job for the next five years.\n\nThe views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own.",

        "KUALA LUMPUR: Illegal land use for agricultural purposes in highland areas has been identified as the main cause of damage to federal roads and slopes that come under the purview of the Works Ministry.\n\nThe situation is endangering road users, particularly during heavy downpours when landslides or mud floods are likely to occur in such places.\n\nOne of the sections prone to landslides is the East-West Highway, notably in the Lojing area in Gua Musang, Kelantan.\n\nA recent survey by the media, which accompanied ministry personnel on the third edition of its East Zone FTRoadpedia Tour recently, found that illegal agricultural activities have encroached on the road reserve in the area concerned, causing rainwater to collect there. Landslides have occurred in the area and caused the road to be cut off.\n\nThe risks posed by illegal land use along federal roads were among the main issues KKR focused on during the FTRoadpedia Tour 3.0 from Aug 11-13. Works Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof was among the 38 top-ranking officials of KKR and its departments and agencies who participated in the programme.\n\nFadillah told reporters that as part of efforts to curb damage to its roads and slopes, his ministry will take firm action to put a stop to the illegal agricultural activities by carrying out integrated enforcement operations with the state government and other related agencies.\n\nHe said that agricultural activities in highland areas must be managed properly, together with proper coordination, planning and integrated action especially if it involves the issue of land being acquired or used without approval.\n\n\"(Encroaching on road reserves) will affect the existing infrastructure (roads), as well as expose the land acquired without following the proper procedures to various risks. What we are afraid of is the occurrence of critical events such as a mud flood as it can cut off the road,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen this happens, many parties will be affected including road users as well as farmers who will not be able to deliver their produce due to the road closure, he added.\n\nThe East Zone FTRoadpedia Tour 3.0, meanwhile, took the delegates on a 1,105-kilometre journey on federal roads from Kuala Lumpur to Pahang, Kelantan and Perak where they also stopped to visit some interesting locations that federal road users can consider visiting as well.\n\nThe minister said continuous efforts must be made to encourage people to use federal roads more often as the government does not want its infrastructure to be underutilised.\n\n\"We want to increase traffic flow on the road network concerned so that people don\u2019t just view them (federal roads) as alternative routes to avoid congestion during the festive season,\u201d he said, adding that driving on the federal roads can be a beneficial experience.\n\n\"The road users can get beautiful views of forests and green hills and there are also many recreational and tourist spots nearby. In fact, they can even choose to spend a night in one of these places. For example, the old road from Bentong to Raub (FT218 in Section 24.80) in Pahang and the main road from Raub to Fraser\u2019s Hill are dotted with tourist spots,\u201d he said.\n\nPointing to Jalan Simpang Pulai-Blue Valley in the Kinta district of Perak, he said the federal road users can visit Cameron Highlands in Pahang which is known for its scenic views, tea plantations and strawberries.\n\nThe Malaysian federal road system is the nation\u2019s main national road network. According to the Ministerial Functions Act 1969, KKR is responsible for planning, building and maintaining all federal roads - totalling 17,830 kilometres in length, including in Sabah and Sarawak - under the Federal Roads Act 1959.\n\nHowever, following the development of highways nationwide since the 1970s, there has been a marked decrease in traffic flow on federal roads.d.\n\n\"Usually during the festive season, road users tend to choose federal roads. They may (for instance) go from Kuala Lumpur to Raub by using the Bentong-Raub road to avoid traffic congestion.\n\n\"Those using the old road will stop at one of the shops in Bentong to eat or get something. Many local residents have also set up stalls along the road (Bentong-Raub) to sell their agricultural produce,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FTRoadpedia Tour participants also visited the new Bailey bridge on the Bentong-Raub route. This bridge, a temporary crossing, was put up after the existing bridge collapsed on Feb 22 during a heavy downpour.\n\nWork on the Bailey bridge started on Feb 24 and the structure was completed three days later.

        "TRUTH be told, it's certainly not the perfect Cabinet line-up. It's likely that Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was pulled from all sides, including by some powerful figures who insisted on their choices of Cabinet representatives.\n\nThe Prime Minister took a longer time than expected to finalise his list since party members and partners in his unity government bombarded his phone with messages and suggestions.\n\nThere were many endless meetings with the stakeholders, which dragged late into the night as the deadline loomed.\n\nHis 5pm press conference to announce the list had to be postponed until 8.15pm, and even that was not punctual.\n\nThe Prime Minister had to honour his pledge for a leaner Cabinet, while balancing the demands of his partners.\n\nAlthough that gave the impression that Anwar had to labour through horse-trading and looked seemingly weak, history tells us that his predecessors had taken even longer.\n\nTun Dr Mahathir Mohamad took 11 days to fully complete his full line-up after GE14 in 2018, which many have conveniently forgotten.\n\nAlso, Anwar is in a more complicated situation. Despite having a two-thirds majority in Parliament, Malaysia is in uncharted waters.\n\nOur nation has never had a unity government comprising partners who just slugged it out in a bruising election.\n\nMany made open pledges of not wanting to work together and slammed each other during campaigning.\n\nBut now, they are in the same government, and surely, they make for strange bedfellows and need a period of adjustment to keep the government intact.\n\nThe period of instability and uncertainty will create some turbulence, but rational Malaysians certainly want this government to work out.\n\nThe alternative, with its many hard-line theologian politicians, seems unpalatable. Perhaps, it's even dangerous to multi-racial Malaysia.\n\nFollowing the race riots in 1969, the Barisan Nasional government was formed, and included the then opposition PAS and Gerakan.\n\nIt was not called a unity government, but the new coalition government worked and functioned effectively under Tun Abdul Razak.\n\nFast forward to 2022, and Anwar is certainly sitting in a hot seat. Apart from facing a strong Malay and religious centric opposition, with PAS' 49 Members of Parliament, doubts will also plague his leadership.\n\nAfter all, the Islamist party has already used the narrative that the Pakatan Harapan government is dominated by the DAP.\n\nLike it or not, Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi has thrown PH a lifeline for Anwar to be the Prime Minister and to lead a federal government. Anwar is indebted to him because without Zahid, he wouldn't be helming the country.\n\nZahid's inclusion has earned the wrath of PH members, but let's not forget that he also faces the same brickbats from BN parties.\n\nWe don't live in a perfect and idealistic world. Realpolitik is the order of the day. Politicians say things they don't mean, and certainly, to paraphrase Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli, it is the end that justifies the means.\n\nThere has also been a strong backlash against the inclusion of former banker Datuk Tengku Zafrul Aziz, who lost in the Kuala Selangor parliamentary constituency.\n\nBut this isn't a new practice. Previously, political leaders who had lost in the elections have been made Senators and appointed to ministerial positions.\n\nThis time, PKR's Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, who lost in his bid for the Kulim Bandar Baharu seat, now heads the powerful Home Ministry, while Barisan Nasional secretary-general Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir, who was defeated in Lumut, is now the Foreign Minister.\n\nFor some reason, Zafrul has been targeted, but like former Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, they are both young talents that Malaysia needs.\n\nUnfortunately, both lost in GE15. Likewise, it is sad that PKR vice-president Nurul Izzah Anwar was beaten in Permatang Pauh by PAS.\n\nBut the inclusion of popular Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh is certainly welcome, although she would be more suitable as Tourism Minister, given her personality, than as Youth and Sports Minister.\n\nSarawakian leader Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, who is Tourism Minister, would be more cut out for an economy-related portfolio, although it can be argued that tourism is a crucial revenue earner.\n\nThey are bright sparks in Malaysian politics who are ready to cut across the political divide and practise bipartisan politics in a mature manner.\n\nNot many, like Zafrul, are ready to leave high-paying positions in the corporate world for politics. How many of us, who prefer to whine, are prepared to make such bold moves?\n\nIt's important that Anwar now focuses on facing the headwinds of 2023. He has correctly placed more emphasis on the economy, cost of living and food security, which will affect people the most.\n\nBesides the economy, the government needs to prove that it can deliver. If it does, then it doesn't need to spend its attention on politicians who rely on race and religion to garner support.\n\nThere should be no place for the politics of revenge and vindictiveness by the new appointees. Leave the civil servants alone.\n\nMalaysians want to see the end of corruption, a better education system, a healthy economy, a fairer government, and one that can make us feel proud of our country again.",

## Notebook 1: Scraping the winners names from news article <a name = "notebook-1"></a>

Web scraping is an essential skill for a data professional. An understanding of the data and its context are imperative in order to extract “correct” information. Without domain knowledge, we may pass the wrong and misleading information to the next analyst. They might use it to build whatever narrative based on their agenda. However, our task is to collect the most accurate data. Here, I present the method to extract election results from a news website article.
